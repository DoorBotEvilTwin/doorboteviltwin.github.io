192 | 759 | 758 | I'm afraid, sieur/dame, your request is unavailable. There is no reason.
193 | 743 | 742 | I'm afraid, sieur/dame, that the chef has eaten it himself. Je suis desol$.
194 | 745 | 744 | The chef says there is no 'ggrrr' in the month. Pardon, sieur/dame.

196 | 749 | 748 | The chef says he has nevaairr heard of it. Je suis desol$.
197 | 751 | 750 | The chef says that in honor of the memory of his sainted mother he will not cook that dish again.
198 | 753 | 752 | The chef says that this is very dirty food. He will not cook dirty food.
199 | 755 | 754 | The chef has gone to Betelgeuse to visit his cousin. And by the way, he is very naughty. And dead.
200 | 757 | 756 | I'm afraid, sieur/dame, I cannot accede to such an extraordinary culinary request. And that is all there is to it.
201 | 571 | 570 | You would do well to forsake that line of enquiry, my friend.
202 | 711 | 710 | You say so? Then I will fight you!

248 | 501 | 500 | It is very simple, I think. You must make sure that each of Boppy's musicians has their part set up correctly, you must set the machine to record and then let the band play!
249 | 503 | 502 | You must listen, you cloth-eared idiot person!
250 | 621 | 620 | D'accord.
251 | 367 | 366 | I think so! I will fight you!
252 | 829 | 828 | Sieur/dame, I do not wish to be rude, but nevertheless, I am.
253 | 871 | 870 | I am amazing, n'est-ce pas?
254 | 873 | 872 | I am a Bot.
255 | 1249 | 1248 | I do not know.
256 | 369 | 368 | Then have a care, sieur/dame, have a care! I am very tense with this terrible music!
257 | 371 | 370 | Then do not molest me with your incontinent words! Consult, instead, the menu!
258 | 877 | 876 | I don't feel so good.
259 | 405 | 404 | You mock me with with this... this semantic nicetiness? This tomfoolery of the tongue? I will fight you! Ha Ha! Now you see, huh?
260 | 407 | 406 | I mean that I have bested you in the combat of the jest, my friend!
261 | 725 | 724 | I think you will not like the chicken.
262 | 727 | 726 | I insist that you will not like the chicken.
263 | 729 | 728 | Then I insist that I insist that you will not like the chicken!
264 | 731 | 730 | Then I insist that I insist that I insist that you will not like the chicken!
265 | 733 | 732 | Well, you can't have it anyway.
266 | 737 | 736 | Then I will fight you!
267 | 735 | 734 | Because you can't.
268 | 851 | 850 | I thought so.
269 | 393 | 392 | Menu sieur/dame? What menu?
270 | 695 | 694 | The bill is, as always, too elevated to contemplate.
271 | 841 | 840 | Right in front of you.
272 | 415 | 414 | Oh, I don't know about that sieur/dame... Maybe a little stressed.
273 | 607 | 606 | En effet.
274 | 933 | 932 | Indeed.
275 | 885 | 884 | Interesting.
276 | 391 | 390 | All of life is a puzzle, I think. No?
277 | 789 | 788 | In my experience, there is always a bomb on board.
278 | 849 | 848 | It is a possibility.
279 | 803 | 802 | English food. Ha ha ha ha ha!
280 | 631 | 630 | Johnny Holiday!
281 | 763 | 762 | I do not recognize that as a foodstuff!
282 | 563 | 562 | Just because!
283 | 1217 | 1216 | LiftBot.
284 | 811 | 810 | That is not music! That is the sound of a thousand sparrows farting!
285 | 813 | 812 | You call that music? That is the sound of a pig vomiting.
286 | 815 | 814 | I do not listen to this! I would rather stick my head in a cow's bottom!
287 | 809 | 808 | I would rather hear a singing camel!
288 | 853 | 852 | Lovely!
289 | 719 | 718 | It means that I am the waiter who must be obeyed!
290 | 277 | 276 | Maybe.
291 | 409 | 408 | You try to embarrass me with my menulessness? I will fight you!
292 | 889 | 888 | Mon dieu!
293 | 693 | 692 | You think so? Then I will fight you.
294 | 577 | 576 | My friend.
295 | 937 | 936 | Neat.
296 | 891 | 890 | Never.
297 | 935 | 934 | Nice.
298 | 769 | 768 | You think so? I do not think so. Maybe. I do not know. Who cares?
299 | 771 | 770 | Nice I do not know. Plentiful I would say.
300 | 279 | 278 | No ?, Are you sure ?
301 | 297 | 296 | Of course not.
302 | 299 | 298 | Of course.
303 | 301 | 300 | Very good.
304 | 303 | 302 | No? I spit on your puny refusal!
305 | 305 | 304 | No? You think I will not fight you, but I will.
306 | 307 | 306 | No? But I insist!
307 | 309 | 308 | No? But I fight you nevertheless!
308 | 311 | 310 | No? You are a contemptible jamjar full of naughty things!
309 | 313 | 312 | No? You are underneath my contempt!
310 | 315 | 314 | No? No?! No???!!
311 | 281 | 280 | I, sieur/dame, am also not so sure now you mention thees.
312 | 317 | 316 | No?
313 | 319 | 318 | No.
314 | 321 | 320 | No.
315 | 323 | 322 | No? Very well. We will stagger on regardless.
316 | 283 | 282 | I understand how you feel, sieur/dame.
317 | 285 | 284 | No? You say so?
318 | 287 | 286 | No? I think you do not mean to contradict me...
319 | 289 | 288 | No? I think you will regret your negativity in this matter.
320 | 291 | 290 | No? Bien sur.
321 | 293 | 292 | No? I understand.
322 | 295 | 294 | I understand.
323 | 579 | 578 | I should not be surprised.
324 | 897 | 896 | Ah yes, but not on weldays.
325 | 1185 | 1184 | Not since last...
326 | 1183 | 1182 | Not until next...
327 | 611 | 610 | Naturellement.
328 | 613 | 612 | Naturellement, bien sur.
329 | 807 | 806 | There is no music but Boppy Headcase.
330 | 833 | 832 | Over there!
331 | 835 | 834 | Over there?
332 | 573 | 572 | Parfait!
333 | 1247 | 1246 | Perhaps the BellBot will be of assistance.
334 | 1181 | 1180 | Perhaps by...
335 | 1245 | 1244 | Perhaps the DeskBot will be of assistance.
336 | 1241 | 1240 | Perhaps the DoorBot will be of assistance.
337 | 1243 | 1242 | Perhaps the LiftBot will be of assistance.
338 | 1237 | 1236 | I do not know. Perhaps the.
339 | 799 | 798 | Ah, it is you once more. Do you have the delectable music of Boppy?
340 | 545 | 544 | Possibly.
341 | 549 | 548 | Possibly not.
342 | 543 | 542 | Probably.
343 | 547 | 546 | Probably not.
344 | 325 | 324 | Enfin! Enough! You win the day! I submit the towel! I throw in the ghost! My white flag enlofts! I yield to your superior bottom-prodding strategies! So! How may I be of assistance to you?
345 | 1187 | 1186 | Al q'Hamra.
346 | 1193 | 1192 | Bristil.
347 | 1191 | 1190 | Genneth.
348 | 1201 | 1200 | Hwhifft.
349 | 1203 | 1202 | Forty days hath Al q'Hamra, Tarbert, Hwhifft, Splod and Vortigan. All the rest have forty, too, i. e., Genneth, m'Bristil and Voedio.
350 | 1205 | 1204 | The lazy days of Splod are here. Rise with the sun, and go down with diarrhea.
351 | 1195 | 1194 | Splod.
352 | 1197 | 1196 | Tarbert.
353 | 1199 | 1198 | Voedio.
354 | 1189 | 1188 | Vortigan.
355 | 623 | 622 | Pret a Porter.
356 | 941 | 940 | Repugnant.
357 | 843 | 842 | Right here!
358 | 1219 | 1218 | RowBot.
359 | 709 | 708 | You say so? Then I will fight you!
360 | 777 | 776 | I think you will find that all of our dishes are already perfectly seasoned, sieur/dame.
361 | 879 | 878 | You can say that again.
362 | 721 | 720 | Not from here, I'm afraid.
363 | 827 | 826 | Sieur/dame.
364 | 575 | 574 | Sieur/dame.
365 | 1173 | 1172 | I have tried, sieur/dame, I have tried.
366 | 635 | 634 | Skol!
367 | 893 | 892 | Sometimes.
368 | 783 | 782 | Non, sieur/dame, I speak... Waiter.
369 | 791 | 790 | Treat it like a woman! Interrupt it all the time!
370 | 881 | 880 | Stop it!
371 | 419 | 418 | Please do not make jokes about my condition, sieur/dame, or I will fight you.
372 | 327 | 326 | Ah, I think not, sieur/dame.
373 | 329 | 328 | Sieur/dame, allow me to correct you. I think I know my own tables in my own restaurant, no?
374 | 331 | 330 | Tables do not suddenly become empty for M. Naughty Words! I will fight you!
375 | 867 | 866 | That amazes me!
376 | 863 | 862 | That's good.
377 | 865 | 864 | C'est merveilleux!
378 | 583 | 582 | That is normal.
379 | 587 | 586 | That is not normal.
380 | 1233 | 1232 | the BellBot.
381 | 1229 | 1228 | the DeskBot.
382 | 1227 | 1226 | the DoorBot.
383 | 1231 | 1230 | the LiftBot.
384 | 831 | 830 | There!
385 | 761 | 760 | There is no reason.
386 | 615 | 614 | Voila!
387 | 617 | 616 | Et le voila!
388 | 555 | 554 | I think not.
389 | 553 | 552 | I think so.
390 | 585 | 584 | This is normal.
391 | 589 | 588 | This is not normal.
392 | 931 | 930 | Undoubtedly.
393 | 707 | 706 | You will not be so fussy after reading the menu!
394 | 601 | 600 | Very good!
395 | 603 | 602 | Tres bien!
396 | 605 | 604 | Bien!
397 | 581 | 580 | I would be vairry surprised.
398 | 801 | 800 | Vive la France!
399 | 413 | 412 | No, you are wasting mine. You want to do something useful? Change the music! The night is yet young...
400 | 1179 | 1178 | I think she was a very fine person, of course.
401 | 1177 | 1176 | I think he was a very fine person, of course.
402 | 525 | 524 | What indeed, my friend, what indeed.
403 | 529 | 528 | Whatever.
404 | 541 | 540 | What do you think?
405 | 685 | 684 | Whatever sieur/dame wants.
406 | 357 | 356 | Monsieur Naughty Chef.
407 | 433 | 432 | He leaves in a teeny leetle bit of a tizzy!
408 | 431 | 430 | M. Scraliontis, he comes into my restaurant, of course, he hands me a small piece of Titania's brain, of course, and then, after M. Leovinus enters also and throws me to the ground, of course, and the two of them fight like tigers with my arms, of course, and M. Leovinus biffs M. Scraliontis mightily with, I think it is my left arm, of course, M. Scraliontis sits and lingers mightily over his caf$, of course.
409 | 385 | 384 | How can anybody do anything with this terrible music playing?
410 | 449 | 448 | M. Scraliontis is the accountant. Need I say more?
411 | 451 | 450 | I think M Scraliontis he was boiling his books!
412 | 429 | 428 | M. Leovinus and M. Scraliontis, they fight lustily!
413 | 421 | 420 | I get a little bit picked up and then a tiny bit thrown to the ground, and then I think just the merest soupcon stamped on. And I think it is just possible that my limbs were torn off and used in hand to hand combat. Pouff! It happens.
414 | 781 | 780 | We are lost in space. The robots are out of control. The ship's cyberintelligence is in pieces. I could cope with it if it wasn't for this terrible music.
415 | 779 | 778 | I think it is you. I did not like to say. But now I have. Damn.
416 | 715 | 714 | I am D'Astragaar, D'Astragaar, D'Astragaar. At your service.
417 | 597 | 596 | Whatever you say, sieur/dame.
418 | 527 | 526 | Hnn, whenever.
419 | 683 | 682 | Whenever sieur/dame likes.
420 | 517 | 516 | That is not a part of the ship that I frequent, sieur/dame.
421 | 523 | 522 | Where indeed, my friend, where indeed.
422 | 531 | 530 | Wherever.
423 | 535 | 534 | Where do you think?
424 | 681 | 680 | There, there, there, can't you see where I'm pointing ?
425 | 379 | 378 | This is the First Class Restaurant. Do you have a reservation?
426 | 383 | 382 | We are vairry busy tonight, sieur/dame. I do not know that we can squeeze you in.
427 | 381 | 380 | Tut tut tut. I think not, sieur/dame.
428 | 477 | 476 | I think it is currently serving M Scraliontis who lingers very greatly over his caf$!
429 | 483 | 482 | There are some naughty cylinders there, but to get a cylinder of Boppy Headcase, you must get it from Boppy!
430 | 795 | 794 | In the universe, my friend, in the universe.
431 | 475 | 474 | Sacre Vert! At the end of my arm!
432 | 701 | 700 | You will have to ask one of the other Bots. I do not concern myself with this tedious matters of geography.
433 | 703 | 702 | Ask another Bot, sieur/dame!
434 | 435 | 434 | He is not here. How should I know?
435 | 471 | 470 | It is here in my hand.
436 | 473 | 472 | Oh yes it is.
437 | 479 | 478 | It is in the lobby of the restaurant.
438 | 699 | 698 | The music room you will be able to reach via the Pellerator on the Second Class Canal.
439 | 797 | 796 | We await them, sieur/dame.
440 | 461 | 460 | I think it is highly distributed.
441 | 459 | 458 | It is, I think in the traditional place. On her neck!
442 | 457 | 456 | I think she is in her chambre.
443 | 845 | 844 | I would not know where to begin.
444 | 513 | 512 | You have put your little finger on the throbbing heart of the mystery, there, I think.
445 | 515 | 514 | I do not know, my friend, I do not know.
446 | 507 | 506 | Who indeed, my friend, who indeed!
447 | 377 | 376 | I am the Maitre d'Bot. I am at your service, very much so.
448 | 713 | 712 | I am your Maitre d'Bot here in the lovely lovely lovely restaurant for the first class passengers on the Starship Titanic.
449 | 697 | 696 | Boppy is the King of Bop! You will find him in the music room boogie-woogieing with his Laid-Back Loafers!
450 | 447 | 446 | M. Brobostigon is the manager of this great enterprise. He is a great man with a great girth!
451 | 423 | 422 | It was M. Leovinus. But I think it was a leetle accident. He was very stressed. I think he has a tiny disagreement with M. Scraliontis. But you do not wish to hear this, do you?
452 | 425 | 424 | Then I shall fight you!
453 | 427 | 426 | But sieur/dame, you mistake me for some person who is not the absolute soul of discretion! How can you think this of me? I will fight you!
454 | 353 | 352 | Our chef is a very brilliant but naughty man.
455 | 443 | 442 | You don't know who is M. Leovinus? Sacre vert! He is le grand fromage! Le camembert enorme! It is M. Leovinus who designed this ship!
456 | 509 | 508 | Speak to me of no parrot! I will not discuss this infernal bird!
457 | 445 | 444 | M. Scraliontis is the great counter of the beans! He is the chief accountant of the building of the Starship Titanic!
458 | 455 | 454 | Sacre vert! Titania is the essence of the ship! She is the one through whom flows all the intelligence of the ship, and she is, I think undone! Her head, I think, is in bits!
459 | 485 | 484 | He is in the music room, you fool!
460 | 511 | 510 | Why indeed, my friend, why indeed. Why is the sky blue? Why is the sea yellow? Why does my heart sing with delight whenever it hears the lyrical melodies of Boppy Headcase? Who can tell, my friend, these mysteries are not for us to know. Whatever.
461 | 519 | 518 | Why indeed, my friend, why indeed.
462 | 537 | 536 | Why do you ask?
463 | 539 | 538 | Why do you think?
464 | 355 | 354 | He does very naughty things with food. I think you will find it vairry delicious and naughty.
465 | 437 | 436 | I think M Scraliontis he was boiling his books!
466 | 793 | 792 | Emptiness is a state of mind, my friend.
467 | 453 | 452 | I think he does not like to find M Scraliontis waving around bits of Titania's brain, hnnn?
468 | 351 | 350 | Because it is such a nice menu! I love to talk of it! It is my hobby!
469 | 691 | 690 | Because I am a man of taste and discernment. I think this is clear.
470 | 569 | 568 | That is why I am the Maitre d'Bot.
471 | 1239 | 1238 | will be of assistance.
472 | 489 | 488 | Ai ai ai ai ai! That brain-twisting so-called music naughty sound is worse than what was on before! Take it off! Take it off!
473 | 491 | 490 | No no no! That is not music! That is like a lawn-mower in my intestines! Please take it off! Give me Boppy!
474 | 493 | 492 | Take it off! Take it off! Give me the music of Boppy!
475 | 495 | 494 | What have you done to Boppy's music! The bass is all wrong! This is worse than no Boppy!
476 | 497 | 496 | You have broken Boppy's tune in a naughty way! The bottleblower is all wrong! You have offended my ears vairry greatly!
477 | 499 | 498 | What have you done to Boppy? You have made Boppy play his part all wrong! Oh poor, poor Boppy! Poor poor me!
478 | 227 | 226 | Tres bien.
479 | 245 | 244 | I am altogether all over happy.
480 | 247 | 246 | It is of nothing.
481 | 249 | 248 | There is not a word.
482 | 251 | 250 | Ca va.
483 | 253 | 252 | Bien.
484 | 255 | 254 | Bien sur.
485 | 257 | 256 | Certainment.
486 | 259 | 258 | You say so, do you? But what do you do?
487 | 261 | 260 | You think so? I challenge your confiance!
488 | 263 | 262 | You say so? I spit on your compliance!
489 | 229 | 228 | Bon,
490 | 265 | 264 | You think so do you? Then have at you, you... person!
491 | 267 | 266 | Yes? You say so?
492 | 269 | 268 | Yes! I spit on your yes!
493 | 271 | 270 | Oui? I go like this at your affirmative rejoinder!
494 | 273 | 272 | Yes? But of course.
495 | 275 | 274 | Yes.
496 | 231 | 230 | Bon bon bon bon bon.
497 | 233 | 232 | Hnnn!
498 | 235 | 234 | Then let us accelerate ourselves here, mightily.
499 | 237 | 236 | I am therefore very happy. For the moment.
500 | 239 | 238 | You think so, hnnn?
501 | 241 | 240 | I am so happy to be of service.
502 | 243 | 242 | I am happiness altogether.
503 | 929 | 928 | Yes, and what fun it is.
504 | 927 | 926 | Yes, and what fun it was.
505 | 883 | 882 | Oh, yes, that's good.
506 | 869 | 868 | You amaze me very much.
507 | 411 | 410 | Just my little joke, sieur/dame. I think you are vairry amused.
508 | 875 | 874 | You are very clever.
509 | 785 | 784 | It is this terrible music. It makes me very tense.
510 | 395 | 394 | Aha! Aha! I have no menu. . Ha! Ha! Ha Ha! HaHaHaHaHa! First blood to me, I think.
511 | 859 | 858 | You think so?
512 | 1527 | 1526 | Absolument.
513 | 1783 | 1782 | You mock me, sieur/dame. I am a Maitre d'Bot.
514 | 1593 | 1592 | Ow!
515 | 1595 | 1594 | aiie!
516 | 1597 | 1596 | ouch!
517 | 1599 | 1598 | Please stop it!
518 | 1517 | 1516 | The bombe surprise is not a dish we favour in this restaurant, sieur/dame. I wish we could be rid of it.
519 | 1775 | 1774 | I think you are a little confused, sieur/dame. That is what I ask you.
520 | 1799 | 1798 | I can. But maybe I do not wish to. Had you considered that, my friend? Hein?
521 | 1801 | 1800 | I recommend some dishes.
522 | 1803 | 1802 | What dishes would you like me to recommend?
523 | 1453 | 1452 | I do not know. I do not care.
524 | 1807 | 1806 | Extreme naughtiness. So - he is dead.
525 | 1519 | 1518 | Chicken? Non, sieur/dame, our dishes favour ingredients un peu plus elev$ et distingu$.
526 | 1677 | 1676 | Aha!
527 | 1695 | 1694 | Zut!
528 | 1697 | 1696 | Die, cue!
529 | 1679 | 1678 | Aha!
530 | 1681 | 1680 | En garde!
531 | 1683 | 1682 | Have at you!
532 | 1685 | 1684 | Blaggard!
533 | 1687 | 1686 | Swish and swipe!
534 | 1689 | 1688 | Zounds!
535 | 1691 | 1690 | Swish and swipe!
536 | 1693 | 1692 | Oo!
537 | 1833 | 1832 | Enfin! Enough! You win the day! I submit the towel! I throw in the ghost! My white flag enlofts! I yield to your superior bottom-prodding strategies! So! I invite you to join Monsieur Scraliontis at his table. Bon Appetit!
538 | 1559 | 1558 | Desol$.
539 | 1625 | 1624 | I do not wish to know this.
540 | 1411 | 1410 | Perhaps I can render a leetle assistance by plying you with my lovely menu.
541 | 1413 | 1412 | Bien sur, I am enchant$ to help, if you are perhaps enchant$ to help me.
542 | 1629 | 1628 | Perhaps I can render a leetle assistance by plying you with my lovely menu.
543 | 1631 | 1630 | Bien sur, I am enchant$ to help, if you are perhaps enchant$ to help me.
544 | 1637 | 1636 | You? You ask me for help who has woefully prodded me in my Achilles buttock? I think not sieur/dame.
545 | 1549 | 1548 | Here and there.
546 | 1273 | 1272 | No, take it away! The bass playing person is out of tune!
547 | 1291 | 1290 | I think it is all too much for Boppy now. He just wants to get it over with as quickly as possible. What a terrible night for Boppy!
548 | 1293 | 1292 | I think the strain is telling on poor Boppy. I think he is slowing down. I hope this is not the end of his magnificent career!
549 | 1295 | 1294 | It's all getting a bit much for Boppy isn't it? He's not even playing at all now.
550 | 1297 | 1296 | Poor Boppy! I think he is a little down in the dumps, non? This is not like him at all!
551 | 1299 | 1298 | Ah, these music playing persons and their naughtiness! I think that Boppy is a little high, non?
552 | 1301 | 1300 | No! This is terrible! I mistrust that serpent! He is playing too fast!
553 | 1303 | 1302 | What a sad and terrible sound! I think it is that serpent sliding along too slow!
554 | 1305 | 1304 | Quelle cacophonie!
555 | 1307 | 1306 | Do you think that dear Boppy is well in himself?
556 | 1309 | 1308 | Do you think that the naughty Bass playing person is quite right?
557 | 1275 | 1274 | No, no! How can poor Boppy work in such conditions? The Bass playing person is a nincompoop!
558 | 1311 | 1310 | Do you think that the naughty serpent thing is quite right?
559 | 1313 | 1312 | It sounds not right to me!
560 | 1315 | 1314 | The bells, as normal, are comme il faut, but I am not sure about the others.
561 | 1333 | 1332 | It is better, but I'm still a bit worried about Boppy.
562 | 1335 | 1334 | It is better but I do not think that the Bass playing person is right yet.
563 | 1337 | 1336 | It is better but I do not like the sound of the serpent!
564 | 1339 | 1338 | Ah! That sounds a bit better. The Bass playing person is improving!
565 | 1341 | 1340 | It is a pity about Boppy, though.
566 | 1343 | 1342 | I do not like the sound of the serpent, though.
567 | 1345 | 1344 | At least the serpent is now correct!
568 | 1347 | 1346 | It is a pity about Boppy, though.
569 | 1349 | 1348 | It is a pity about the Bass playing person, though.
570 | 1351 | 1350 | Dieu merci! I had such great anxiety about Boppy, but he seems to be playing beautifully now, quite beautifully.
571 | 1353 | 1352 | It is a pity about the serpent, though.
572 | 1355 | 1354 | It is a pity about the Bass playing person, though.
573 | 1357 | 1356 | It still sounds as a cacophony, though. Poor Boppy! Quel dommage.
574 | 1277 | 1276 | This is terrible! Is the Bass playing person standing on his head?
575 | 1359 | 1358 | Quelle cacophonie! Poor Boppy!
576 | 1361 | 1360 | I so much hate this travesty of Boppy's music!
577 | 1363 | 1362 | Quelle cacophonie! Poor Boppy!
578 | 1365 | 1364 | Is there not a Bot in attendance who can assist you?
579 | 1367 | 1366 | By the music machine, no?
580 | 1369 | 1368 | You look at that serpent thing! Do you see any evidence of ears? Non! Do you hear any evidence of ears? I think not!
581 | 1371 | 1370 | That serpent! He makes squeak squeak noises, much too high!
582 | 1373 | 1372 | That damn serpent, he slinks around playing too low!
583 | 1375 | 1374 | You would not trust a serpent to know which way was up, would you!
584 | 1377 | 1376 | Our chef, he says it is difficult to tell one end of a serpent from the other. This serpent, he does not know one end of a tune from the other!
585 | 1279 | 1278 | What a cacophony! Do you think the bass is trying to get to the bar before the others? I cannot bear this noise!
586 | 1379 | 1378 | The bells player is a tower of the strength, non?
587 | 1381 | 1380 | Whatever else goes wrong, he is right. Of course, being the only one in step doesn't make you sound right!
588 | 1383 | 1382 | I think the player of the bells is in his own world, no?
589 | 1385 | 1384 | Always steady, always correct.
590 | 1387 | 1386 | Ah! The bells fall silent I see! The only one who never makes a mistake is silenced. Ah well, no good deed ever goes unpunished.
591 | 1389 | 1388 | And now we have no bells. That is a pity. At least the bells playing person was always correct.
592 | 1391 | 1390 | Getting better. Long way to go, but getting better.
593 | 1281 | 1280 | No, this is a travesty of Boppy! The Bass playing person is falling asleep!
594 | 1283 | 1282 | The Bass playing person has no respect for the music of Boppy! He plays back to front!
595 | 1285 | 1284 | I think the Bass playing person is sulking now. He's not bothering to play at all. It could be worse.
596 | 1287 | 1286 | Poor Boppy! what have you done to him! You have made him play back to front! You are philistine!
597 | 1289 | 1288 | Poor Boppy! Have you stood the maestro on his head! Shame on you!
598 | 1317 | 1316 | This pitch is too low.
599 | 1319 | 1318 | This pitch is too high.
600 | 1321 | 1320 | He plays his part upside down!
601 | 1323 | 1322 | He plays his part back to front?
602 | 1325 | 1324 | The tempo is all wrong!
603 | 1327 | 1326 | He plays trop vite!
604 | 1329 | 1328 | He plays a little slow, I think.
605 | 1331 | 1330 | He does not play at all!
606 | 1393 | 1392 | I am vairry, vairry, vairry happy, I am glad to say. Except of course for the music.
607 | 1251 | 1250 | Aha, You cannot, my fine friend. I am a fighting waiter in his prime.
608 | 1435 | 1434 | I think it would be vairry good, but I do not know if it is possible.
609 | 1437 | 1436 | By excelling.
610 | 1561 | 1560 | I do not know. I have no understanding of the technologie.
611 | 1563 | 1562 | I think this is a probleme that you will have to piece together yourself, sieur/dame.
612 | 1565 | 1564 | Perhaps it is a matter of the psychologie, non? Non.
613 | 1475 | 1474 | Humming.
614 | 1477 | 1476 | Humming.
615 | 1395 | 1394 | Ah, tant pis. Too bad.
616 | 1835 | 1834 | Tell me you submit!
617 | 1837 | 1836 | Tell me again!
618 | 1839 | 1838 | Tell me again with feeling!
619 | 1841 | 1840 | Oh. Fair enough. But you cannot have a table! Ha! I win.
620 | 1405 | 1404 | Alors. Bien. Tcchh.
621 | 1525 | 1524 | Immediatement.
622 | 1459 | 1458 | The only puzzle is how I remain sane with this atrocious music. Perhaps I do not, sieur/dame, perhaps I do not.
623 | 1495 | 1494 | Leovinus.
624 | 1259 | 1258 | No. There are wine lists on the tables! There are no menus!
625 | 1465 | 1464 | Mutter mutter.
626 | 1467 | 1466 | Mutter mutter.
627 | 1469 | 1468 | Mutter mutter.
628 | 1471 | 1470 | Mutter mutter.
629 | 1473 | 1472 | Mutter mutter.
630 | 1407 | 1406 | I have no reservation in that name. All our tables are occup$. Je suis desol$.
631 | 1409 | 1408 | What a strange name. I'm D'Astragaar.
632 | 1529 | 1528 | My pleasure.
633 | 1399 | 1398 | Enchante.
634 | 1401 | 1400 | Bien sur.
635 | 1397 | 1396 | A beautiful starry night. As always.
636 | 1705 | 1704 | Oh no he isn't.
637 | 1709 | 1708 | Oh no it doesn't.
638 | 1721 | 1720 | Doesn't doesn't doesn't doesn't.
639 | 1701 | 1700 | Oh no it isn't.
640 | 1717 | 1716 | Isn't isn't isn't isn't.
641 | 1741 | 1740 | This silence is terrible to me! It is like the emptiness of space! Play me the music of Boppy!
642 | 1743 | 1742 | My soul cannot endure this silence of no music! Let the music of Boppy soothe my spirit!
643 | 1745 | 1744 | Please! Spare me this terrible aching void of silence!
644 | 1747 | 1746 | I beg you bring me music! And not that awful naughty music, but the delightful music of Boppy!
645 | 1713 | 1712 | Oh no they don't.
646 | 1725 | 1724 | Don't don't don't don't.
647 | 1633 | 1632 | My ears are grossly besieged by this musique excecrable. Perhaps you can replace it with mellifluity?
648 | 1553 | 1552 | Oh, things.
649 | 1521 | 1520 | No chook.
650 | 1667 | 1666 | Aha! You wiggle your pointy thing! Have at you! Have at you vairry much indeed!
651 | 1669 | 1668 | You dare to wiggle your pointy thing at me! I fight you! En garde! Have at you!
652 | 1639 | 1638 | Aha! You retreat, non? I think you are a little cowardly so and so! I despise you vairry much for you do nothing!
653 | 1657 | 1656 | I say you fight me!
654 | 1659 | 1658 | Fight! Fight me! I insist!
655 | 1661 | 1660 | Fight me! I implore you! My manhood demands it! I never deny my manhood!
656 | 1663 | 1662 | You deny my manhood? If you will deny my manhood I will fight you!
657 | 1665 | 1664 | Please, pleeeeease fight! If you do not fight I feel vairry silly!
658 | 1641 | 1640 | You think to rest on your laurels, I think! Beware, sieur/dame for I go swish and swipe at your laurels! I am herbicide to your laurels!
659 | 1643 | 1642 | En garde! Fight me you cowardly not person!
660 | 1645 | 1644 | You think to overcome me with the masterly inactivity, non! I think this strategy will serve you vairry badly because you stink up my brain!
661 | 1647 | 1646 | So you think to defeat me with this doing nothing? I see through your doing nothing! I say that nothing will come of nothing! You are to me a nothing person!
662 | 1649 | 1648 | Laugh.
663 | 1651 | 1650 | You think to rest in the centre of the battle? You think perhaps some nice person bring you orange slices? I think not, sieur/dame, I think you must fight!
664 | 1653 | 1652 | Fight me, sieur/dame, fight me!
665 | 1655 | 1654 | Pick up your pointy thing and fight, damn you!
666 | 1671 | 1670 | Ah! You think to move your pointy thing away from me! This running awayness I despise! Come back here and wiggle that!
667 | 1673 | 1672 | You think you will escape me with your pointy thing! Return into the fray, return I say!
668 | 1675 | 1674 | Come back here with your pointy thing! Fight like a man that I may kill you like a dog!
669 | 1749 | 1748 | Have a care that you do not provoke me, sieur/dame, I do not wish that we become enemies over this matter.
670 | 1751 | 1750 | I ask you to exercise a little caution in what you say, sieur/dame. I do not wish to fight you.
671 | 1753 | 1752 | Do not make me fight you, sieur/dame.
672 | 1755 | 1754 | I do not wish to biff you in my restaurant, sieur/dame.
673 | 1757 | 1756 | Please adjust your manner to me sieur/dame, that we may not come to blows.
674 | 1759 | 1758 | I issue this warning. Do not molest me, that we may not come to swishing and swiping!
675 | 1761 | 1760 | You wish that we come to swishing and swiping? I think not! Desist therefore, naughty sieur/dame.
676 | 1627 | 1626 | The pur$e is off, today.
677 | 1619 | 1618 | You like the dance? You like the way in which I wiggle my hips? Non?
678 | 1617 | 1616 | If this interests you, you should pay a visit to Boppy.
679 | 1621 | 1620 | I am not a sailor.
680 | 1611 | 1610 | Science.
681 | 1613 | 1612 | I think I know this name. I think they have not paid their bill. It is enorme!
682 | 1609 | 1608 | If you will speak in this manner with me, I will be hot in the collar and will fight you!
683 | 1615 | 1614 | I do not read this book. It is written by a parrot.
684 | 1623 | 1622 | I am sorry, but my TLA server is down.
685 | 1785 | 1784 | Non, I am completely perfect. The music, however, is broken.
686 | 1765 | 1764 | We do not discuss the competition.
687 | 1523 | 1522 | Right away.
688 | 1533 | 1532 | It is right behind you.
689 | 1531 | 1530 | It is right here.
690 | 1557 | 1556 | Tant pis. Too bad.
691 | 1811 | 1810 | Oh yes. Zut. I forgot.
692 | 1733 | 1732 | Ouch! Please! That too is my arm!
693 | 1735 | 1734 | Menu, sieur/dame? What menu. I deny all knowledge of a menu.
694 | 1487 | 1486 | Atchoo...
695 | 1489 | 1488 | Atchoo...
696 | 1479 | 1478 | Snore.
697 | 1481 | 1480 | Snore.
698 | 1483 | 1482 | Snore.
699 | 1555 | 1554 | Some business I had to attend to.
700 | 1269 | 1268 | You think all is not perfect for you, my friend? You set yourself up as an arbiter of such matters do you, do you?
701 | 1601 | 1600 | Huh?
702 | 1603 | 1602 | Pardon?
703 | 1605 | 1604 | Say again?
704 | 1607 | 1606 | Repeat please!
705 | 1827 | 1826 | I think not, my friend. Monsieur Scraliontis lingairrs very much over his caf$. He is a true gastronome!
706 | 1727 | 1726 | That table is occup$.
707 | 1729 | 1728 | That table also is occup$.
708 | 1731 | 1730 | That table especially is occup$.
709 | 1423 | 1422 | I think you mistake me, sieur/dame. I am the Maitre d'Bot.
710 | 1537 | 1536 | Thank you.
711 | 1539 | 1538 | De rien.
712 | 1541 | 1540 | Mon plaisir.
713 | 1543 | 1542 | I am glad to be of the assistance.
714 | 1545 | 1544 | If there is anything else you wish you have only to ask.
715 | 1551 | 1550 | This and that.
716 | 1461 | 1460 | Hurr hun...
717 | 1463 | 1462 | Hurr hun...
718 | 1763 | 1762 | Starship Titanic - the boat which cannot probably turn badly.
719 | 1547 | 1546 | Up and down.
720 | 1445 | 1444 | I think it is a supernova. It is quite pretty, I think. Perhaps a little overdone.
721 | 1455 | 1454 | I have no need of such things. I am what I am.
722 | 1451 | 1450 | I know nothing of these. I am not as other Bots.
723 | 1805 | 1804 | The chef recommends the Chef's Speciality.
724 | 1457 | 1456 | You should be elegant and soign$, and you should enjoy the beautiful food and the beautiful view.
725 | 1439 | 1438 | Nothing. It is not my concern.
726 | 1773 | 1772 | Our renown, sieur/dame.
727 | 1415 | 1414 | There was un petit fracas. A little disagreement, I think, over some minor matters. Monsieur Leovinus was a little exercised, I think. And Monsieur Scraliontis was not at his best. But I am the Maitre d'Bot. I do not gossip, you understand.
728 | 1789 | 1788 | It is Titania's Auditory Center, of course. I just happen to have it about my person.
729 | 1737 | 1736 | We are lost in space. The robots are out of control. The ship's cyberintelligence is in pieces. I could cope with it if it wasn't for this terrible silence!
730 | 1403 | 1402 | I am the Maitre d'Bot. I am witty and charming and a purveyor of menus.
731 | 1431 | 1430 | If we are lost, we are lost. It is a matter of indifference to me.
732 | 1793 | 1792 | I love the mellifluous musical stylings of Boppy Headcase and his Laid-Back Loafers. It is the music I adore!
733 | 1771 | 1770 | Our famousness, of course.
734 | 1797 | 1796 | Everything, sieur/dame. Every dish, every table, every tiniest detail is special.
735 | 1491 | 1490 | Nothing you should concern yourself with.
736 | 1567 | 1566 | Time to look at the menu, perhaps?
737 | 1569 | 1568 | Dinner time.
738 | 1791 | 1790 | I hardly know where to begin. It is an offence to the ears! It is a foul and nasty clattering sound! It is audible piffle!
739 | 1433 | 1432 | I think her head is in bits. It is vairry bad for her.
740 | 1571 | 1570 | Never.
741 | 1573 | 1572 | Immediatement.
742 | 1575 | 1574 | Right away.
743 | 1577 | 1576 | Soon.
744 | 1579 | 1578 | Later.
745 | 1581 | 1580 | Earlier.
746 | 1583 | 1582 | Just missed it.
747 | 1585 | 1584 | Perhaps you should hurry.
748 | 1587 | 1586 | Whenever you like.
749 | 1253 | 1252 | This is the First Class Restaurant, sieur/dame, as is extremely evident, I think.
750 | 1429 | 1428 | It is outside the restaurant. That is all.
751 | 1591 | 1590 | The bar.
752 | 1589 | 1588 | You are in the finest restaurant in the galaxy. Where else would you wish to go?
753 | 1417 | 1416 | Blerontin.
754 | 1427 | 1426 | Where we come from, where we go, is of no matter to me. I am concerned only with the gastronomie, the etiquette, and the swishing and swiping.
755 | 1535 | 1534 | You're standing in it, you fool.
756 | 1421 | 1420 | You go out of the restaurant. After that, I do not care.
757 | 1257 | 1256 | Where is what menu? Where is the menu that does not exist? How can I answer such a question?
758 | 1795 | 1794 | There is no menu.
759 | 1419 | 1418 | I do not know. It is not a matter with which I concern myself.
760 | 1441 | 1440 | Everybody who is not inside my restaurant is outside my restaurant and therefore of no concern to me, sieur/dame.
761 | 1443 | 1442 | I cannot tell you. It is of no concern to me.
762 | 1425 | 1424 | I do not wish to speak of matters of the bottom, sieur/dame.
763 | 1769 | 1768 | We expect many, many guests. We are fully booked, of course. We are a very renowned restaurant.
764 | 1497 | 1496 | Brobostigon.
765 | 1447 | 1446 | Monsieur Leovinus, the great genius.
766 | 1515 | 1514 | D'Astragaar.
767 | 1511 | 1510 | Fentible.
768 | 1509 | 1508 | Fortillian.
769 | 1819 | 1818 | The great Monsieur Leovinus.
770 | 1501 | 1500 | The Gat.
771 | 1507 | 1506 | Krage.
772 | 1513 | 1512 | Marsinta.
773 | 1503 | 1502 | Me.
774 | 1499 | 1498 | Scraliontis.
775 | 1493 | 1492 | Titania.
776 | 1449 | 1448 | The company is Starlight Lines, sieur/dame.
777 | 1505 | 1504 | You.
778 | 1809 | 1808 | He was too naughty to live.
779 | 1825 | 1824 | You must ask Monsieur Scraliontis.
780 | 1271 | 1270 | You think I like this music! Ptah! I despise it!
781 | 1261 | 1260 | Because of the chef. He is vairry naughty.
782 | 1263 | 1262 | Because I am the Maitre d'Bot! It is my job to offer you the menu, sieur/dame! You would deny me my livelihood?
783 | 1267 | 1266 | Then do not impugn me my menu offering qualities, my friend!
784 | 1265 | 1264 | Then I will fight you!
785 | 1255 | 1254 | Because I am menuless. I am devoid of menus. Le menu? Il n'existe pas.
786 | 1767 | 1766 | I think sieur/dame has not been to many fine restaurants, huh? that you ask such a question.
787 | 1635 | 1634 | I desire the melodies of Boppy! Please to bring them!
788 | 1485 | 1484 | Yawn.
789 | 1703 | 1702 | Oh yes he is.
790 | 1777 | 1776 | Yes I did...
791 | 1779 | 1778 | Yes I did, yes I did...
792 | 1781 | 1780 | I did!
793 | 1707 | 1706 | Oh yes it does.
794 | 1719 | 1718 | Does does does and does.
795 | 1699 | 1698 | Oh yes it is.
796 | 1715 | 1714 | Is is is and is.
797 | 1711 | 1710 | Oh yes they do.
798 | 1723 | 1722 | Do do do and do.
799 | 1787 | 1786 | Ha ha! Sieur/dame's little joke. Let us turn out attention to other matters. Like this terrible music which renders me so distrait!
800 | 1829 | 1828 | I deny that! I deny that utterly!
801 | 1813 | 1812 | I enjoy all fineries of the table.
802 | 1739 | 1738 | It is the frightful emptiness of the silence! It makes me vairry tense.
803 | 1831 | 1830 | You say so, hein? Then I will fight you!
804 | 1823 | 1822 | But I have a rapier wit, no? I shall foil you! You shall see!
805 | 1815 | 1814 | According to Leovinus, he eats just desserts.
806 | 1821 | 1820 | You think so? You try me and soon you shall see!
807 | 1817 | 1816 | You dare to ask this? I think you should ask the great Monsieur Leovinus, my friend!
808 | 11 | 10 | Ah, if it were only possible, sieur/dame. Sadly I seem to have temporarily mislaid the key to the music playing system. It makes me vairry tense, of course, but, I hope we can be friends.
809 | 23 | 22 | I do not wish to speak of this Parrot. It makes me vairry tense. Let us speak instead of the delights of our menu.
810 | 25 | 24 | I do not wish to speak of this BellBot. It makes me vairry tense. Let us speak instead of the delights of our menu.

814 | 33 | 32 | I do not wish to speak of this DeskBot. It makes me vairry tense. Let us speak instead of the delights of our menu.
815 | 35 | 34 | I do not wish to speak of this DoorBot. It makes me vairry tense. Let us speak instead of the delights of our menu.
816 | 163 | 162 | It is a little late for for en garde! I think you now run away!
817 | 1 | 0 | Welcome to the most glamorous dining experience in the whole galaxy, sieur/dame. May I apologize for the music?
818 | 3 | 2 | Bonsoir, bienvenue it is a joy beyond comprehension to greet you tonight sieur/dame or other. I hope that the music will not make you vomit unduly.
819 | 5 | 4 | I must say sieur/dame or other looking more exquisite than I can muster words to express tonight. The music I must apologize for. It is a distress to me.
820 | 7 | 6 | You are, if I may say so, looking ineffably elegant tonight. Very delicious, very soign$. I wish that the music was more suitable to receive you. I hate it very much.
821 | 93 | 92 | Aha! I have the advantage of you I think!
822 | 95 | 94 | A hit! A very palpable hit!
823 | 113 | 112 | Zounds, that smarts!
824 | 115 | 114 | Oh! Be gentle with me! Aha! Now I have you! Never trust a fighting waiter in his prime!
825 | 117 | 116 | You will die here! Here! Here on my very own hearthrug!
826 | 119 | 118 | Vous etes les testicules d'un cochon! I pinch you very hard between my forefingers! I bite you very much!
827 | 121 | 120 | Ah! You are flagging now! You wilt very much indeed! I press home my advantage indeed! Ouch!
828 | 123 | 122 | You fight with a man who fights many times! I am fighting two times already today! You have to be very fit in these days to run a restaurant!
829 | 125 | 124 | Garcons! Garcons! Assistance if you please! Aux arms! Run this blaggard through, sirs, if you please!
830 | 127 | 126 | I die! I die! I expire! No! I'm better again! Have at you! An old trick but it might just work!
831 | 129 | 128 | Ah! You have a stick! Have at you and your stick! I despise your stick very much!
832 | 131 | 130 | Ah! You have a hammer! Have at you and your hammer! I despise your hammer very much!
833 | 133 | 132 | Ah! You have a lemon! Have at you and your lemon! I despise your lemon very much!
834 | 135 | 134 | Ah! You have a chicken! Have at you and your chicken! I despise your chicken very much!
835 | 137 | 136 | Ah! You have a parrot's perch! Have at you and your parrot's perch! I despise your parrot's perch very much!
836 | 139 | 138 | My body outnumbers you!
837 | 97 | 96 | A hit! A very palatable hit!
838 | 141 | 140 | Ha! I penetrate deeply your defences!
839 | 143 | 142 | My driving force propels me forward! I lunge! I engage! I recover from my lunge!
840 | 145 | 144 | You compete with a person at the peak of his flexion and elasticity!
841 | 147 | 146 | Your cause is lost! I make forays in your fertile country!
842 | 149 | 148 | Beware! I bring you into danger! Even with your stick!
843 | 151 | 150 | Beware! I bring you into danger! Even with your hammer!
844 | 153 | 152 | Beware! I bring you into danger! Even with your lemon!
845 | 155 | 154 | Beware! I bring you into danger! Even with your chicken!
846 | 157 | 156 | Beware! I bring you into danger! Even with your parrot's perch!
847 | 159 | 158 | I thrust! I lunge! I display no snail-like wiggling!
848 | 99 | 98 | Submit! Submit!
849 | 101 | 100 | Touch$!
850 | 103 | 102 | Touch$!
851 | 105 | 104 | Take that, that and that! And this also!
852 | 107 | 106 | Have a care, sieur/dame, for I fight very very dirty! I spit and fart and soil myself!
853 | 109 | 108 | Ouch! Ah! Oo!
854 | 111 | 110 | Oof! You are hurting me!
855 | 161 | 160 | And have at you too my fine friend!
856 | 61 | 60 | Dead? I think it is not possible, sieur/dame. Monsieur enjoys a digestive pause. He is a man of the greatest delicacy if not the greatest... vitesse of the payment. He lingers vairry much with his caf$.
857 | 63 | 62 | You think we poison our customers? You think we are a restaurant that wishes to assassinate its esteemed clientele? I think not! If you will say such a thing I will fight you!
858 | 65 | 64 | Then have at you you lying pighound! En garde!
859 | 225 | 224 | I will fight you! I will fight you!
860 | 47 | 46 | I will fetch it for you at once, sieur/dame. I will be just one leetle second, no more!
861 | 9 | 8 | A moment while I consult, sieur/dame. Alors, I find that, inadvertently we have no table reserved for you. I am extremely desolated at this oversight sieur/dame. However, I think we can juuuuuuuust squeeze you in. Damn this music, I hate it so much, excuse my frank.
862 | 205 | 204 | No, you must not play this music! It is an agony of the ears this music concrete. It is the music of the cement mixer! Bring me the mellifluous melodies of Boppy.
863 | 207 | 206 | Not this music! No! I think this is the wall of sound music, but it is a wall against which many people perhaps have excused themselves!
864 | 209 | 208 | Ohhhhh. This is so wonderful. I feel so relaxed.
865 | 211 | 210 | Play it to me, Boppy! It is so lovely and so languorous!
866 | 213 | 212 | I am tossed like a salad on the gentle waves of the melody! It is vairry fine this music!
867 | 215 | 214 | You know, everything on the ship is so shiny. It's twinkling like fairyland.
868 | 217 | 216 | I am transported on a souffle of sound. All is wonderment!.
869 | 219 | 218 | Boy, the ceiling looks reeeeely great from down here.
870 | 221 | 220 | I think maybe I'll have a little snooze. Wake me up for breakfast won't you...
871 | 195 | 194 | Ouch. Please. That too is my arm.
872 | 197 | 196 | If you will derange my arm I will fight you!
873 | 193 | 192 | You do not arouse me. You are boring to me now. Excuse me, now I prefer to hum. Hum her hum hum hum hum hummm her hum...
874 | 85 | 84 | Please, sieur/dame, do not prod me.
875 | 87 | 86 | I say again, do not prod me.
876 | 89 | 88 | Alright. I fight you!
877 | 91 | 90 | Have at you!
878 | 173 | 172 | Ah! You prod me on my Achilles buttock! This you must not do! It pains me vairry much!
879 | 177 | 176 | Do not prod my Achilles buttock!
880 | 179 | 178 | My Achilles buttock! Prod it not with your puny stick!
881 | 181 | 180 | My Achilles buttock! Prod it not with your puny hammer!
882 | 183 | 182 | My Achilles buttock! Prod it not with your puny lemon!
883 | 185 | 184 | My Achilles buttock! Prod it not with your puny chicken!
884 | 187 | 186 | My Achilles buttock! Prod it not with your puny parrot's perch!
885 | 189 | 188 | If you will prod my Achilles buttock you will compel me to give up!
886 | 191 | 190 | I will not fight further! I will not deign to fight one who prods the Achilles buttock! Instead I will sulk vairry much!
887 | 171 | 170 | Ah! You think to prod me on my Achilles heel! You think wrong my fine friend! I fight with renewed vigor!
888 | 199 | 198 | This thing you must not take! I will guard it fiercely for M Scraliontis while he lingers vairry much over his caf$!
889 | 201 | 200 | I resist you vairry strongly! You must not take this thing or I will fight you!
890 | 203 | 202 | Then have at you, you cup of a toad's vitals!
891 | 37 | 36 | Excellent! Excellent! This is more fabulous than I can easily express. And now perhaps we can discuss the lovely menu?
892 | 39 | 38 | But sieur/dame is so incandescently witty tonight! Let us shine your witty light on tonight's menu.
893 | 41 | 40 | Ah sieur/dame always knows what to say. Perhaps if I can insert a tiny word through the side, that tiny word would be menu!
894 | 43 | 42 | Your responses ravish me, sieur/dame, and makes me think that perhaps I ravish you back with my little menu?
895 | 45 | 44 | Sieur/dame, I am enchanted with our little chit chat, but if we do not consider the menu soon perhaps I will twist your head off, no?
896 | 167 | 166 | I will never surrender! Never! Unless... No! I will never surrender!
897 | 73 | 72 | But veritably we are sieur/dame, we are vairry, vairry busy and if you say we are not, I will fight you.
898 | 81 | 80 | Last chance to be escorted to your table, sieur/dame? No?
899 | 75 | 74 | No? Then I will fight you! I will! Have at you! En guard you puny biped!
900 | 83 | 82 | Now are you ready for your table? No? Then take that!
901 | 71 | 70 | Sadly, sieur/dame, we are vairry busy tonight and the other tables are all reserved.
902 | 77 | 76 | You let me show you to your table now? No?
903 | 79 | 78 | I show you to your table? Yes? No?
904 | 53 | 52 | We've got a very special table for you which will be ready just as soon as our previous customer has finished his coffee. He has been there seventeen hours so I am sure he will be calling for the bill in one second.
905 | 223 | 222 | Take it, take it. It is a burden to me! My soul floats on wings of melody and I do not wish to grapple with bits of brain!
906 | 49 | 48 | Please do not disturb me while I fetch the menu, sieur/dame! I will be just one leetle second, no more!
907 | 51 | 50 | That has inflamed your taste buds, I think! Allow me to show you to your table. I think you will find it most elegant and delightful.
908 | 165 | 164 | I think not touch$ my fine friend! I think I have you on the run!
909 | 169 | 168 | Unless nothing! I will never surrender! I am invincible! I have no Achilles heel!
910 | 67 | 66 | It is vairry strange! He enters our delightful restaurant last night carrying this... thing in his hand.
911 | 69 | 68 | And then there comes the great Monsieur Leovinus. He is not, I think, in a good mood, and he shouts very much. So I am vairry smooth and charming to him, and he is in a bad mood still, and I am vairry smooth and charming to him, and he is in a bad mood still, and I am vairry smooth and charming to him, and he rips my arm off - poof! - and throws me to the ground, and I am vairry smooth and charming to him, and he is, I think, much moved and rips my head off, and then I am only a little bit conscious, but I think that they fight a little with my body parts. And then when I awake Monsieur Scraliontis is lingering vairry much over his coffee.
912 | 59 | 58 | He lingers! He lingers vairry strongly! Is the highest compliment to our chef!
913 | 13 | 12 | I do not wish to discuss the whereabouts of the key. It makes me vairry tense.
914 | 15 | 14 | I hope we will not become enemies over the matter of this key, my friend. I give you one more chance not to mention it.
915 | 17 | 16 | So! I fight you!
916 | 19 | 18 | What? And forfeit the element of surprise? You insult me to suggest I am so stupid!
917 | 21 | 20 | Do not jaw jaw me. I war war you!
918 | 57 | 56 | M. Scraliontis is le Comptroller! The Chef of Accountancy for the Starship Titanic. Is a vairry important man. It is a pity he does not pay his staff perhaps as often as is proper, but he is a man of the most exquisite taste. He has lingered over his coffee for seventeen hours!
919 | 55 | 54 | This is our vairry esteemed client and patron M. Scraliontis. He lingers a leetle over his meal, no? Is a man of refined tastes I think.
920 | 175 | 174 | You must not prod me on my Achilles buttock! It is vairry unfair that I cannot wiggle it away!</maitre>

58 | 839 | 838 | Haven't got the foggiest.
59 | 841 | 840 | It is.
60 | 843 | 842 | They do.
61 | 845 | 844 | They are.
62 | 597 | 596 | Just as I suspected.
63 | 847 | 846 | Hmmm, could be.
64 | 849 | 848 | Certainly is.
65 | 851 | 850 | What's the point in that?

67 | 855 | 854 | Oh, I don't know.
68 | 857 | 856 | Love it.
69 | 859 | 858 | Most acceptable.
70 | 861 | 860 | Not so sure about that.
71 | 863 | 862 | I have my reservations.
72 | 599 | 598 | Lovely!
73 | 865 | 864 | I never was a great fan.
74 | 867 | 866 | They have.
75 | 869 | 868 | A little.
76 | 871 | 870 | I know.
77 | 873 | 872 | I should think not.
78 | 875 | 874 | Many times.
79 | 877 | 876 | Never again.

85 | 887 | 886 | Well, I'm not.
86 | 889 | 888 | That is good.
87 | 891 | 890 | A hunch.

105 | 605 | 604 | Whopping!
106 | 925 | 924 | Did she?
107 | 927 | 926 | Did they?
108 | 929 | 928 | Just like you, eh?
109 | 931 | 930 | Just like me.
110 | 933 | 932 | Ruddy typical.
111 | 935 | 934 | It's never too late.
112 | 937 | 936 | I'm not a taxi.
113 | 939 | 938 | Many times.

115 | 943 | 942 | Ah, just like the good old days.
116 | 607 | 606 | How did you know?
117 | 945 | 944 | Takes me back to the good old days.
118 | 947 | 946 | Not much.
119 | 949 | 948 | I'm a Bot.

121 | 609 | 608 | Many's the time.

127 | 621 | 620 | I'm amazing.
128 | 623 | 622 | I'm a Bot.
129 | 625 | 624 | I am an humble Bot, Sir.
130 | 627 | 626 | You're really clever, you know that?
131 | 575 | 574 | Over there?
132 | 629 | 628 | Shows remarkable intelligence.
133 | 631 | 630 | I don't feel so good.
134 | 633 | 632 | Spot of the old trouble. Giving me gyp.
135 | 635 | 634 | You can say that again.

164 | 581 | 580 | Right here!
165 | 689 | 688 | First week of the month.
166 | 691 | 690 | Everyday.
167 | 693 | 692 | Yes, and what fun it was.
168 | 695 | 694 | Indeed, and most diverting it was.
169 | 697 | 696 | Yes, and what fun it is.
170 | 699 | 698 | Indeed, and most diverting it is.
171 | 701 | 700 | Undoubtedly.
172 | 703 | 702 | Indeed.
173 | 705 | 704 | Nice.
174 | 707 | 706 | Most acceptable.
175 | 583 | 582 | Blimey, some people wossname if it were under their nose. Or whatever.
176 | 709 | 708 | Neat.
177 | 711 | 710 | Delightful.
178 | 713 | 712 | Most agreeable.
179 | 715 | 714 | Repugnant.
180 | 717 | 716 | Not quite the thing.
181 | 719 | 718 | I'm not.
182 | 721 | 720 | I am.
183 | 723 | 722 | You're not.
184 | 725 | 724 | You are.
185 | 727 | 726 | You will.
186 | 585 | 584 | I wouldn't know where to begin.
187 | 729 | 728 | Oh.
188 | 731 | 730 | Oh dear.
189 | 733 | 732 | Me too.
190 | 735 | 734 | Please?
191 | 737 | 736 | Yeah, right.
192 | 739 | 738 | No way.
193 | 741 | 740 | Isn't she?
194 | 743 | 742 | Isn't he?
195 | 745 | 744 | Aren't they?
196 | 747 | 746 | Won't they?
197 | 587 | 586 | Hardly know rightly where to start.
198 | 749 | 748 | Won't she?
199 | 751 | 750 | Won't he?
200 | 753 | 752 | Does he?
201 | 755 | 754 | Does she?
202 | 757 | 756 | Do they?
203 | 759 | 758 | Go on.
204 | 761 | 760 | Is that so?
205 | 763 | 762 | Is that right?
206 | 765 | 764 | My goodness.
207 | 767 | 766 | Well bless my soul.
208 | 1029 | 1028 | Now who'd drink an old soldier like me?
209 | 993 | 992 | Afraid duty would not permit it.
210 | 1047 | 1046 | Well, they're films.
211 | 1021 | 1020 | Masses. Forgotten it all, though.
212 | 1069 | 1068 | You trying to get me shot?!
213 | 953 | 952 | Never had time for that sort of thing. Frippery. Too busy soldiering.
214 | 961 | 960 | Ah well that's all down to a matter of taste, as my old C. O. said, it would be a sad world if we was all alike.
215 | 951 | 950 | Never had time for that sort of thing.
216 | 959 | 958 | Take it or leave it.
217 | 995 | 994 | Only inadvertently.
218 | 1025 | 1024 | Knew a bloke as did.
219 | 1011 | 1010 | Lethally so in my younger day.
220 | 1015 | 1014 | I suppose it depends on the lightbulb.
221 | 981 | 980 | Memory's a blank.
222 | 1067 | 1066 | Ah, that's more than my job's worth.
223 | 1041 | 1040 | Never took anything. Always paid my way.
224 | 969 | 968 | Don't really get the opportunity, what with being embedded in this personal transportation device and unprovided with such diversions.
225 | 973 | 972 | Not as such, though it's not for me to say.
226 | 991 | 990 | Not exactly.
227 | 1051 | 1050 | Not for me to say.
228 | 967 | 966 | Don't get much time for that in my job.
229 | 997 | 996 | No time for them.
230 | 977 | 976 | Not in a literal sense.
231 | 987 | 986 | Not to speak of.
232 | 1035 | 1034 | Not to speak of.
233 | 1073 | 1072 | No way. No way. Can't be done. No, no, definitely no. If you take my meaning.
234 | 971 | 970 | Only in that sense of the word.
235 | 1005 | 1004 | Everyone to their own opinion.
236 | 1037 | 1036 | Probably, but it was dark.
237 | 1003 | 1002 | Ah well I'm glad you asked that it's an interesting question I often wonder the same thing myself but do you know in all the time I've been here which isn't long although it seems like ages although I wouldn't know, ages being what they are, which I have to say is not what they used to be, where was I, rambling again, tsk tsk tsk. . . no.
238 | 1007 | 1006 | Ah well, rubbish is as rubbish does.
239 | 957 | 956 | Can't rightly recall. It's this Asgon's Tregeriasis. Plays havoc with your. . . what's it called? Never mind.
240 | 965 | 964 | No, now that's where you're lucky to have your borms intact, you see, because if your borms isn't intact you has difficulty in what you might call actually liking anything.
241 | 955 | 954 | Can't rightly recall.
242 | 963 | 962 | Makes me feel poorly just to think about it.
243 | 989 | 988 | Well yes. And no. In a manner of speaking.
244 | 1039 | 1038 | Soldiers don't try. They succeed.
245 | 1045 | 1044 | Ah, well, there you are then.
246 | 1075 | 1074 | Ummm...
247 | 983 | 982 | Up to a point.
248 | 1049 | 1048 | Very fine if you like that sort of thing.
249 | 1043 | 1042 | Watch your mouth.
250 | 1013 | 1012 | Had one once but the wheel came off.
251 | 1001 | 1000 | Wondering the same thing myself.
252 | 985 | 984 | That's your privilege.
253 | 1243 | 1242 | Yes Sir.
254 | 1261 | 1260 | At your service, Sir.

259 | 1245 | 1244 | Yes Sir.
260 | 1247 | 1246 | Right away Sir.
261 | 1249 | 1248 | Consider it done, Sir.
262 | 1251 | 1250 | No sooner said than done, in a manner of speaking.

438 | 1385 | 1384 | Aching borms, Sir; aching borms.
439 | 1387 | 1386 | Blibber acting up, Sir.
440 | 1389 | 1388 | Asgon's tregeriasis acting up, Sir.
441 | 1391 | 1390 | Spot of the old trouble but can't complain.
442 | 1393 | 1392 | Spot of the old wossname. Giving me gyp.
443 | 1239 | 1238 | You will find the lift floor indicator just behind you, Sir.
444 | 1405 | 1404 | That must be fascinating, Sir.
445 | 1093 | 1092 | Cor blimey. . . hello?. . . stap my vitals and pickle me dhagwalla, must have lorst me head for a moment there, where were we, battle of bin j'Jabli was it. . . is that you, Ginger?. . . hello? hello? Oooh! Wot? It's you, Sir. Well I think I owe you a vote of gratitude.
446 | 1415 | 1414 | No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. No. Definitely not. No, no no. Yes.
447 | 1095 | 1094 | Me? Terrible, but can't complain when there's others - no names, no pack drill, LiftBot Number Four, oops -- wot has entirely lorst their heads.
448 | 1097 | 1096 | Pretty rough thank you, but better than some as as bin rendered eadless by cruel fate.
449 | 1099 | 1098 | Still got my head thank you very much.
450 | 1459 | 1458 | Still worrying about that bomb, are we, Sir?
451 | 1471 | 1470 | Bomb, Sir? Not the sort of thing we'd have on this ship.
452 | 1461 | 1460 | Wouldn't let that bomb prey on your mind, Sir.
453 | 1473 | 1472 | Bomb, Sir? Nobody mentioned a bomb to me.
454 | 1463 | 1462 | My advice, Sir, is relax and don't even think about the bomb.
455 | 1475 | 1474 | Bomb. Sir? Lost me arm on account of a bomb, I think I'd know if there was one on board.
456 | 1407 | 1406 | Well, yes, it would be. Just as mine would be RSM Nobbingt. . no, just call me Nobby.
457 | 1503 | 1502 | My pleasure.
458 | 1505 | 1504 | Don't mention it.
459 | 1507 | 1506 | It's my job, Sir.
460 | 1509 | 1508 | Nothing to it.
461 | 1341 | 1340 | And what floor would that be, Sir?
462 | 1343 | 1342 | Ah well, Sir, now that's what your PET is for, Designer Room Number Mode, whatever that means.
463 | 1403 | 1402 | I am sure I will be able to say the same in due course, Sir.
464 | 1345 | 1344 | Not now, Sir, I'm working.
465 | 1363 | 1362 | Quick march!
466 | 1365 | 1364 | Present arms!
467 | 1347 | 1346 | Yes, Sir. You have my full attention.
468 | 1349 | 1348 | Can't be done Sir, as a cursory inspection would indicate.
469 | 1351 | 1350 | Very funny, Sir. Very droll.
470 | 1353 | 1352 | Can't be done, Sir.
471 | 1355 | 1354 | Right, Sir. Halted. What now?
472 | 1357 | 1356 | Sprinklers'll take care of that, Sir.
473 | 1359 | 1358 | At ease soldier.
474 | 1361 | 1360 | Attention!
475 | 1229 | 1228 | There are 39 floors, but this lift only goes to floor 27.
476 | 1227 | 1226 | There are 39 floors.
477 | 1101 | 1100 | Don't see no point in that line of questioning.
478 | 1119 | 1118 | I've been trying to rack my brain about that myself, Sir. Trouble is, it doesn't seem to rack like it used to.
479 | 1121 | 1120 | Way outside my limited parameters of operational competence, that sort of thing.
480 | 1103 | 1102 | You wot? You wot? You wot?
481 | 1105 | 1104 | You WOT?
482 | 1107 | 1106 | Not with you.
483 | 1109 | 1108 | Lorst me there, Sir.
484 | 1111 | 1110 | Why there?
485 | 1113 | 1112 | Don't know nothing about that, Sir.
486 | 1115 | 1114 | Need to know basis, that, Sir.
487 | 1117 | 1116 | That sort of thing is down to successful hintellectuals like yourself, Sir.
488 | 1077 | 1076 | Which is a mood point given my wossname. Condition.
489 | 1079 | 1078 | Though seeing as I can hardly move what with my blibber and all. . . well, say no more, that's my motto.
490 | 1081 | 1080 | I just hope the experience'll limber me up, given me state of health.
491 | 1083 | 1082 | Though don't be surprised if I disintegrate with sheer agonizing agony.
492 | 1085 | 1084 | Even if I die in the attempt.
493 | 1087 | 1086 | Though having said that, it's the last thing on my mind, which is a mere blur of pain.
494 | 1089 | 1088 | And I'm glad one of us is in a state of health to give consideration to such matters.
495 | 1091 | 1090 | And may I say I wish I could think about things like that. Or like anything. But the agony, Sir; the raw majestic agony...
496 | 1131 | 1130 | Elevator 1.
497 | 1133 | 1132 | Elevator 2.

503 | 1129 | 1128 | Lift 4.
504 | 1279 | 1278 | Beyond my sphere of operations, Sir. I only patrol between floors 1 and 27. You'd best be having word on the Q. T. with my colleagues in lift 1 or 3.
505 | 1225 | 1224 | Doesn't exist. Thirty-nine floors - that's your lot. Like it or lump it.
506 | 1277 | 1276 | Beyond my scope, Sir. My brief only covers floors 1 to 39.
507 | 1139 | 1138 | This is Lift 1.
508 | 1141 | 1140 | This is Lift 2.
509 | 1143 | 1142 | This is Lift 3.
510 | 1145 | 1144 | This is Lift 4.
511 | 1609 | 1608 | Been in the Army, Sir. Know about conspiracies. Can't be done.
512 | 1611 | 1610 | One thing I enjoy, Sir, it's a good conspiracy.
513 | 1619 | 1618 | Was a time, Sir, madam or thing, when I was famous for my reborzo. . . but my dancing days is over now.
514 | 1635 | 1634 | I'd show you, Sir, but me legs is gorn.
515 | 1617 | 1616 | Big business, music, these days. Just have a look in the Music Room and you'll see what I mean.
516 | 1613 | 1612 | Music, eh? They got music onboard, in the. . . now where would it be. . . the Music Room, I think, though I may be wrong.
517 | 1615 | 1614 | Often fancied going into music myself, Sir, except I didn't have the talent or the interest.
518 | 1621 | 1620 | Well stap me vitals.
519 | 1623 | 1622 | Shiver me timbers.
520 | 1625 | 1624 | Pickle me dick.
521 | 1627 | 1626 | Blow 'ard, me hearties!
522 | 1629 | 1628 | Thar she blows!
523 | 1631 | 1630 | Spouter on the starboard bow!
524 | 1599 | 1598 | Where would we be without science, Sir? At home, with our feet up, I expect.
525 | 1601 | 1600 | Got a lot of respect for science, me. Something. . . scientific about it, know what I mean?
526 | 1603 | 1602 | I'd heard they do a bit of science on Earth.
527 | 1331 | 1330 | Sorry, Sir... not as nimble as I used to be.
528 | 1333 | 1332 | Sorry Sir. . . not so spry as I was.
529 | 1335 | 1334 | Sorry Sir. . . but there's nothing so urgent you can't take your time.
530 | 1337 | 1336 | Sorry Sir. . . but slow-but-sure, that's my motto.
531 | 1339 | 1338 | Sorry Sir. . . but steady does it.
532 | 1605 | 1604 | You been hanging around with that Digital Village lot, then? Very distinguished, I must say.
533 | 1589 | 1588 | Ere! Less of that!
534 | 1591 | 1590 | Oy! Wash your mouth out with soap!
535 | 1593 | 1592 | Drop it, Sir. . . knock it orf.
536 | 1595 | 1594 | Watch your lip.
537 | 1597 | 1596 | Don't come that sort of talk with me.
538 | 1607 | 1606 | See you're a bit of a reading man, Sir. You might enjoy a chat with that filthy parrot.
539 | 1633 | 1632 | Sorry, but the TLA server is down.
540 | 1579 | 1578 | eh?
541 | 1581 | 1580 | Sorry?
542 | 1583 | 1582 | Speak up.
543 | 1585 | 1584 | Could you repeat that please, I didn't hear you.
544 | 1587 | 1586 | Huh?
545 | 1491 | 1490 | Thank you.
546 | 1493 | 1492 | Very kind.
547 | 1495 | 1494 | Most obliging.
548 | 1497 | 1496 | You're a gent, Sir.
549 | 1499 | 1498 | Very decent of you and all.
550 | 1501 | 1500 | All in a day's work.
551 | 1299 | 1298 | Yes, the Arboretum. Trees, if memory serves; a very seasonal place in a manner of speaking.
552 | 1305 | 1304 | Ah well, now you're talking, Sir, bit of a jar, few tinctures, just the one, that's the ticket, bit merry, one over the eight, three sheets in the wind not to mention legless, terrible night, whirly pit, regret it in the morning, never again, sign the pledge, I'd come with you, Sir, but I'm nailed to my post.
553 | 1307 | 1306 | Don't envy you that, Sir, not the bilges, all that. . . bilge and what have you, though very nice bilge it is, as bilge goes.
554 | 1301 | 1300 | Lovely canal, Sir, if you can tolerate the singing; and I speak as one who knows canals.
555 | 1303 | 1302 | They do say, Sir, as how music soothes the bosom, Sir, though I haven't noticed it myself.
556 | 1297 | 1296 | Very nice food they do there, too, Sir, if you happen to like nice food.
557 | 1237 | 1236 | Top of the well.
558 | 1747 | 1746 | Top of the Well.
559 | 1791 | 1790 | the battle of bin-j'Jabbli, you may have heard me mention that, carnage it was, carnage and suffering. And anguish. Carnage, suffering and anguish. Sometimes you got carnage. Other times you got anguish. Other times you got suffering. Sometimes you got a mixture. Carnage and suffering. Carnage and anguish. Anguish and suffering. Anguish and carnage. Anguish, suffering and carnage. Begin to get the picture? Best years of my life.
560 | 1793 | 1792 | that day at Phlegnos, the Balneans grouped above us on the commanding heights of the Pelopennopolopoulos, General Shatton with his borms shot to ribbons, you could hear his blibber raggling from half a bile away, anyway, down come the Balneans uttering their horrible war cry of "Ere. Wotch your step" and striking horror into every man's allenoids, WHOMP! they went URGH! SPLOD! TWANG! yuss, it was all scribble and tink and hello cor blimey, until all of a sudden I got my head shot orft and everything went not so much black as a rather effeminate purple but you get what your given in this life, that's my motto, what's your motto, same as mine I expect, wouldn't be surprised, young buggers, what do you do, nuffink, right? Right. End of story.
561 | 1795 | 1794 | Wimpers, a battle as was seared in the remembery of everyone what fought and died there. . . pointless it was, thrumping about in the splod, up to your queeg in albol and flard with the Snazzis ranged on every corner and poor old General Perman with his ob clamped shut and everything all wet and eably, the only word for it was "hardihosh" but we didn't care, we was fighting troops and "Mmmppph" says General Perlman through his clamped ob and off we charged, mown down in waves, it was a massacre but I'll tell you wot, we enjoyed it.
562 | 1797 | 1796 | down in the devastation of Hadjadji, desert country of course and sodden. Sodden. Sodden it was. Sodden, and the sinkimutts up to the top of your wope and your doings jammed - we had Heckler & Kock & Snartigern & Eably & Erasthidmites & Eably's Cousin's Friend Nerick point four-five calibre wossnames, which was always prone to blogging, but what we done, we waved them at the tribesmen and when they saw them they thought to themselves (and you could see them thinking it because Johnny Tribesman has never been any good at disguising his emotions) they thought, blimey, HKSWWWCFN . 45 calibre wossnames, and charged across the burning devastation and massacred us to the last man, but was we downhearted? No. It was OUR IDEA OF FUN.
563 | 1799 | 1798 | Blobberlobberlop. . . a massacre, that was, seeing as how we'd not been properly trained, you see wee was used to other conditions, bin-j-Jabbli, Wimpers, Hadjadji, Phlegnos, that was the terrain we'd been trained for, flat mountainous parched sodden muddy sand and sheer icy rock baking in the fetid jungle heat. But Blobberlobberlop was something different, so when the Blobberlobberloppi came flubberlubberlubberling along, well, we was hacked to pieces, not a man left standing, but we didn't bear a grudge, no, nothing personal, we was fighting men, and a premature agonizing death in a meaningless conflict engineered by imbecilic politicians and greedy arms dealers, werl, that was what we was trained for, soo? It was meat and drink to us.
564 | 1775 | 1774 | Madhouse, it was,
565 | 1777 | 1776 | Nightmare, it was,
566 | 1779 | 1778 | Course you wouldn't remember, but
567 | 1781 | 1780 | Can hardly bear to talk about it, but
568 | 1783 | 1782 | It's not something I like to chat about, casual-like, but
569 | 1785 | 1784 | Reminds me of wossname,
570 | 1787 | 1786 | Funny you should say that, but it takes me back to, what,
571 | 1789 | 1788 | War stories.
572 | 1231 | 1230 | That's just the way it is, Sir.
573 | 1397 | 1396 | I have no doubt you are correct, Sir.
574 | 1399 | 1398 | Don't have time for fripperies like that, Sir.
575 | 1401 | 1400 | Course it is, Sir; this is the Starship Titanic.
576 | 1275 | 1274 | Fraid that's on a need-to-know basis Sir. . . but since you need to know, it's exactly the same as an elevator, Sir, except bent. Inasmuch as it goes up-and-down in a crabwise fashion, Sir. Sideways, as you might say.
577 | 1447 | 1446 | Cellpoint settings, Sir, control my mood in all its rich complexity.
578 | 1647 | 1646 | Elevator - it's a kind of lift, Sir.
579 | 1649 | 1648 | Lift - it's a kind of elevator, Sir.
580 | 1367 | 1366 | A nasty disease, Sir. Spread by them filthy parrots. Eradicate the lot of them, that's what I says.
581 | 1529 | 1528 | It's high time you got a move on.
582 | 1531 | 1530 | It's "now". You'd better hurry before it's "too late".
583 | 1533 | 1532 | Never.
584 | 1535 | 1534 | Immediately.
585 | 1537 | 1536 | Right away.
586 | 1539 | 1538 | Soon.
587 | 1541 | 1540 | Later.
588 | 1543 | 1542 | Earlier.
589 | 1545 | 1544 | Just missed it.
590 | 1547 | 1546 | If you hurry you might just make it.
591 | 1549 | 1548 | Whenever you like.
592 | 1413 | 1412 | If you means where should it be, directly astern, Sir. If you means where it actually is, your guess is as good as mine.
593 | 1433 | 1432 | See if you can guess, Sir. BarBot? BAR Bot? That's right, Sir! The Bar.
594 | 1437 | 1436 | Skiving off and gossiping, I imagine, Sir. Just call him on your PET.
595 | 1431 | 1430 | Marsinta? Embarkation Lobby, generally speaking.
596 | 1435 | 1434 | DoorBot? Just call him on your PET.
597 | 1429 | 1428 | Werl. . . here, Sir.
598 | 1553 | 1552 | Militarily speaking, the obvious target is often the right one. In this case, the Bar.
599 | 1551 | 1550 | Call me old-fashioned, Sir, but I'd try the restaurant.
600 | 1427 | 1426 | No, Sir, it works the other way round: you tell me that, Sir.
601 | 1425 | 1424 | No mystery about that, Sir. It's just what we call "a mystery".
602 | 1411 | 1410 | Vastan, Sir, as soon as a slight positional uncertainty has been resolved.
603 | 1409 | 1408 | Conveniently located, Sir. "Conveniently". . . gettit? Never mind.
604 | 1511 | 1510 | Up and down.
605 | 1513 | 1512 | Here and there.
606 | 1515 | 1514 | This and that.
607 | 1517 | 1516 | Just going along in my rut.
608 | 1519 | 1518 | So so.
609 | 1521 | 1520 | Comme ci comme ca.
610 | 1523 | 1522 | I've had my ups and downs.
611 | 1525 | 1524 | Nothing special.
612 | 1527 | 1526 | Nowhere special.
613 | 1419 | 1418 | Nothing, Sir. Nothing at all. Just a temporary non-reversible dysfuctionality, to use the military term. You'd probably call it "busted", Sir.
614 | 1417 | 1416 | Not a lot of help, Sir. I mean, we may know where we are, but we don't know where 'where we are' is.
615 | 1809 | 1808 | Some sort of floor you wanted was it?
616 | 1807 | 1806 | Floor?
617 | 1805 | 1804 | I expect you'll be wanting a - oooooh! Floor.
618 | 1801 | 1800 | Starlight Lines.
619 | 1803 | 1802 | The Starship Titanic.
620 | 1811 | 1810 | Where to or what is it then?
621 | 1819 | 1818 | Your allenoids. . . your allenoids. . . werl, your allenoids, see, they sort of feed your splanck. Drip drip drip. Blibber fluids. Allenoid goes up the spout, you starve your splanck of blibber fluids and it's next stop, Asgon's Tregeriasis.
622 | 1835 | 1834 | Very complicated system, the anphosterous system, very complicated and complex. A kind of a. . . system, really, governed by the workings of the anphosterous wossname, which supervises, gland, anphosterous gland, that's the word. Supervises. . . well, supervises the anphosterous system, protects your splank, stimulates your wabs, that kind of thing.
623 | 1823 | 1822 | Blimey, all I can say is, I hope you never find out about aphoritis. I've been a martyr to aphoritis all my born days, starts in the allenoids and worms its way along to the borms, and then you've had it, you're a husk, the doctors is baffled, sticking things in your caprifornium, numb blebs, the lot.
624 | 1831 | 1830 | Arthusia? Werl, if you're unlucky enough to get a wound, as it might be a war-wound as a result of valiant military action in the face of overwheleming odds, and this war-wound happens to be in your, you know, bazonium. . . well, next thing you know, you're sitting - painfully - in the surgery while the doc is saying "Yeah, right, Nobby, what you got is Arthusia and there's nothink we can do".
625 | 1821 | 1820 | Asgon's tregeriasis? Horible, that is. Wouldn't wish it on a wossname. You don't want to get Asgon's tregeriasis, Sir, Madam or Thing, not if you're given the chance. Worse than aphoritis, it is. Someone comes up to you, says "Here, d'you fancy Asgon's tregeriasis?" you just punch them in the blibber and run for it.
626 | 1833 | 1832 | Your bazonium? All I can say is, you look after your bazonium. Don't take it for granted like so many young people these days. I neglected my bazonium and next thing you know, war wound, not wearing my bazonium protector, and WHOP! , uncle Arthusia comes to call, makes my life a misery and a living hell.
627 | 1845 | 1844 | You're joking. Aren't'cha? Say you're joking. What'd they teach you? I mean, what do you think you land on when you go over after a skinful with the lads on the first night's leave you've had since the outbreak of war? 'S right. Your blebs. Blimey.
628 | 1817 | 1816 | Blibber? Just down from the allenoids and left a bit. You want to hope nothink goes wrong with your blibber is all I can say.
629 | 1815 | 1814 | Borms? Your borms is your vitals. Lose your borms, you've had it. Might as well try and do without your blibber.
630 | 1825 | 1824 | Class of its own, the caprifornium. You just count yourself lucky you've got a caprifornium in good working order. Might as well try and live a full wossname with Arthusia as a knackered caprifornium. Life. A full life.
631 | 1849 | 1848 | Doings? Werl, it's a wossname, innit. A wossname.
632 | 1839 | 1838 | Don't want to talk about galleria, really. Not the thing. Just say it's one of those. . . conditions as what military individuals, being as how they are away from home much of the time and has to take their fun where they can find it, is prone to.
633 | 1841 | 1840 | Not much to say, Sir Madam or Thing. Mystery, really. Medical science is baffled. "Gernophilis, " they say, looking grave. "You what?" you say. "Gernophilis, " they say, not looking you in the eye. All I can say is, I hope you never get it. Five minutes of self-indulgence and your life's in tatters, Sir, madam or thing; shreds and tatters. Like your wabs.
634 | 1829 | 1828 | Ah. Nasty side-effect of arthusia, your samorrhoids. Not something you'd want to talk about in company. Like galleria.
635 | 1827 | 1826 | Werl. . . your splanck. . . your splanck. . . werl, it's fed by your allenoids, isn't it? Your allenoids, they feed your splanck with blibber fluids. Lose your splanck, you might as well have lost your blibber. Next stop, Asgon's tregeriasis.
636 | 1813 | 1812 | Tharpoid? Well, you won't get far without your tharpoid. It's up there with the borms, your tharpoid is.
637 | 1837 | 1836 | Treems? You don't know about treems? Blimey, what do you do at weekends? Cor, I know your sort, can't find your own bleb with both hands and a flashlight.
638 | 1843 | 1842 | Blimey, Sir madam or thing; easy to see you've never been unfortunate enough to suffer from gernophilis or you wouldn't even be able to bring yourself to UTTER the word "wabs". They'd be in tatters. Shreds and tatters.
639 | 1847 | 1846 | Wossname? Werl, it's a doings, innit. A doings.
640 | 3 | 2 | Ah, well, funny you should say that, Sir, because in what you might call my fleshly incarnation, before I had the personality donation and blew my brains out, I did in fact only have one arm and one leg. Battle of bin-j'Jabbli, Sir. Fuddy-duddies. Nice chaps, brave soldiers, good show, nasty business, rough deal, bad luck. Bang! Leg. Bang! Arm. Bad luck. Good fun.
641 | 11 | 10 | Old army expression, Sir, when I was serving under General Shatton, or maybe it was Perman, never can recall these things but a fair fight, Sir, and the best side won. Our side.
642 | 19 | 18 | Very good, Sir, and I'll tell you something you might not know, little matter of military history: the Amalon warrior-women used to cut off their own right arm so that it didn't get in the way of their breast-- no, hang on, that's wrong. No. I tell a lie. Left arm.
643 | 27 | 26 | Good day to you, Sir, Madam or Thing, and a great deal better than some of the days we've been having recently. Indeed, my old trouble has quite cleared up so that it will be a pleasure to attend to your vertical transportation requirements.
644 | 35 | 34 | Bit of a bootstrap operation, that, Sir. Bit beyond me, although you might not think so given my occupation now, even though I have been used to better things.
645 | 43 | 42 | Morning, or whatever. Sir! I don't suppose you were ever a military man, military woman, thing no, silly of me, let's keep it simple, I goes up, I goes down, which is it to be?
646 | 51 | 50 | Morning, Sir, I was just thinking about the first time you come into my lift, "Nobby, " I thought at the time, "Here's someone in your lift" because one thing the army does, it trains you to notice things.
647 | 59 | 58 | Hello, Sir. I was just wondering if you was going to step in here, and here you are, which just goes to show.
648 | 67 | 66 | Hello, Sir. Nice day for vertical transportation, although between ourselves I'd rather be trotting up the ha'aqa bin-j'Jabbli in my p'narma hat, heading for the rebel headquarters with a grenade under my q'jinjan.
649 | 75 | 74 | Ready for action, Sir, and happy to take you anywhere in a vertical direction to what you may wish to travel, halways assuming you is duly authorized as I need ardly had.
650 | 83 | 82 | Hello, Sir. Decided to stay put, then? Very wise. Fomenting discord, I call it, printing stuff like that, encouraging discontent, it's a very nice class you're in, sort of NCO class, very nice indeed, and don't let nobody tell you different.
651 | 91 | 90 | Ah well, Sir, you don't let every little injury get you down. There are always people worse off than you.
652 | 99 | 98 | I am honored to be a robot, Sir. Worked my way up. Being a robot aboard the Titanic, Sir, is like being a color sarnt-maj in a good regiment. Respect. Duty. Discipline. Keep your gun clean, your trousers creased and your hands outside the bedclothes, won't go far wrong.
653 | 107 | 106 | I'm tempted to agree with you, Sir, and in my day we'd have had it up on a charge, had the whole ship up on a charge, peeling splods, extras, jankers, call it what you will.
654 | 115 | 114 | That's not the half of it, Sir. There's things aboard this ship that suck like an unweened seal pup, though I says it as shouldn't. SS Titanic? SS Dorothy, more like.
655 | 123 | 122 | Can't remember, Sir.
656 | 131 | 130 | Yes, well, you might say that, and on the other hand you might not. Reminds me of the Battle of the Broyne, where I lost my leg. Doesn't bother me much now, though, Sir. And this isn't getting us anywhere.
657 | 139 | 138 | I was just thinking the same thing, Sir, and it put me in mind of Nipper Dalgetty and the Bogstar campaign, 'cos I hadn't set eyes on Nipper since Bastern Four, you see, and there he was, large as life, twice as ugly. "Blimey, Nipper, " I says, "So we meet again. " "I was just thinking the same thing, Nobby, " says Nipper, "and it put me in mind of old Snorker Figgis, and. . . " well, you get the picture, Sir.
658 | 291 | 290 | A wise choice, Sir. Vertical transportation is what I do best, given the circumstances under which I am supposed to operate. It's not what I am used to, though.
659 | 147 | 146 | Personally I have never felt better in my life, Sir, but then my body never gave me much trouble now I look back on it. Out of sight, out of mind; that's what I say.
660 | 155 | 154 | Orders, Sir. What you need is an upgrade. No ticket, no entry. Got to have orders. Know where you stand, then. As long as you've got you health and you've got your orders, you're all squared away and ready for anything the enemy cares to throw at you.
661 | 163 | 162 | Ah well. Sir. That's a very interesting thought that is. I remember discussing the same idea with Chalky White in a foxhole outside Wimpers. "Chalky, " I says, "You don't exist. " "No more do you, " says Chalky. "Fair enough, " I says. "How's about a himaginary cuppa char, then?
662 | 171 | 170 | Missed the best days of your life, then, Sir. It'd have been something to look back on when you're a disembodied transplant stuck in a series of ruddy lifts in a starship with personality problems. At least you'd have your memories.
663 | 179 | 178 | No, no, Sir, regard it as a courtesy title. As they say, a little courtesy does no harm. No matter how unworthy you may personally feel.
664 | 541 | 540 | Other lift, Sir? It depends how you mean, other. All for one, one for all, whatever goes up comes down, whatever goes down comes up, whatever happens to me happens to him, whatever happens to him happens to me. It's called soldiering, Sir. Four minds but with a single thought. Sometimes not even that many.
665 | 543 | 542 | Other lift, Sir? Just one of us, Sir. Four jobs to do. Life's like that, so I've found.
666 | 545 | 544 | Other lift, Sir? It's as much as a man at my time of life should be expected to do doing one job, but here you see, I've got four. Four bodies, one mind, you see. Well, you know what they say, a pain shared is a pain halved. Well, they're wrong. A pain shared is a pain doubled. Or in my case quadrupled.
667 | 187 | 186 | It was a parrot as was the mascot in the 33rd Rottingdean Foot Horse when there was that trouble with the Old Man, Sir, or it may have been the 24th Rustington Light Heavy Foot Cavalry. Chalky White in the officers' mess waving a saber and three kitchen-maids weeping in the scullery, if you follow my drift.
668 | 211 | 210 | Down? Lovely direction. Takes me back to my army days. Loved down, I did. Anyone said "Volunteers wanted for down, " there I was. Two paces forward, stamp, salute, yes Sir, right away Sir, I'm your man.
669 | 195 | 194 | Up? Oh, excellent. Oh, I'm so glad you said "Up, " Sir. The moment I saw you, I thought, my goodness, this one has "Up" written all over it, and so it was. Spooky, eh?
670 | 227 | 226 | Now, Sir, now, Sir, no need to take that tone with me, I've got a difficult job to do here and I'd just like to be allowed to get on with it in peace and never mind your rudeness. Tried that in my younger day, I'd have had your throat out, I would.
671 | 235 | 234 | Now, Sir, now, Sir, that won't do, and you know it and I know it, and no point you trying to circumvent me, if that's the word, because rules is rules and there was a time when you'd have bin shot, Sir, shot on the spot like a Balnian at Phlegnos except we're not in the army now, Sir, are we?, so just leave it alone. With respect.
672 | 243 | 242 | No, Sir, no; think of what is becoming, Sir. How would it be if everyone did everything for themselves? You'd have no rank, no structure, it would be anarchy, Sir, anarchy, next thing you know there's be no respect, blood flowing in the streets, you name it, I bin there.
673 | 251 | 250 | Ah, well, Sir, going through a bad patch at the time. Nothing left to believe in, nothing to fight for, someone had to keep the old memories alive so I became a personality donor and blew my brains out. Which wasn't hard, given I'd been trained for it. Never looked back since.
674 | 259 | 258 | Shut up? Shut up? Let me tell you. If you'd of said that to me when I was a fighting man. I'd have. I'd have. Fought you. And no mistake.
675 | 363 | 362 | Well, Sir, there's plenty of rooms aboard this ship that fit the bill and many as ought to but don't due to circumstances I don't wish to go into. . . and there's nothing I'd like better than to spend the rest of eternity ferrying you from one to the other, but frankly I don't think you'd last the course.
676 | 379 | 378 | Wouldn't mind seeing the old place myself either, Sir, plenty of fond memories, none of them my own of course but you know how it is when you're what you might call retentive. Whacker got his eye put out there, old Deggsy, he was a funny bloke, mind you, he saw the way the place was going, got himself transplanted just before it went down the lizard. Rhyming slang, Sir, lizard on the hearthrug, plug.
677 | 387 | 386 | Well a nice idea, Sir, nice try, but no can do. Not how life works. Reminds me of the siege of Sidi ben Abed, holed up for eleven weeks, skin and bone, eating rats and Gawd knows what the rats was eating, "I wish it was all over" says Stonker Barrington. "Stonker, " says I, "Nice idea, but not how life works.
678 | 323 | 322 | Gaw, Sir, I can see the luxury is working its old magic, mental processes slowing down, a devil-may-care loucheness creeping over you and who can blame you, I went that way after three months posted to Berrocca, you just stop bothering about things like specifying which floor you want.
679 | 395 | 394 | Home, Sir? Where's home? What I say is, as long as you've got your health, home is wherever you hang your hat, if you have a hat, which is why you'll never see a soldier without one. Not home, hat. Otherwise how would he know where he was home, without a hat to hang? See? Once you know the facts, it all makes sense.
680 | 331 | 330 | Very much in favor of that class, Sir. In fact, call me old fashioned, I think it's one of the nicer classes on the ship, and well supplied with floors which brings me to the point, Sir, which is: could you be a little more specific in your orders because heaven help you if you was a officer, Sir, being that vague.
681 | 371 | 370 | Of course in the old days, Sir, that would have been First Class but everything's got more luxurious now. Perfumed soap. Breeding a generation of softies if you ask me, but nobody ever does.
682 | 299 | 298 | On the move, Sir? That's right. Time spent in reconnaissance is never wasted, as that chap General wotsisname, you know, the Sprod bloke, used to say. He's dead, now, Sir. Ambushed. Walked into a trap, hacked to pieces.
683 | 339 | 338 | Yes, Sir, all much of a muchness, that class, but then when you've been under canvas as much as I have you get used to much of a muchness. I mean it's up to you, Sir, take your chances with the random malignity of fate, or give me a specific floor.
684 | 219 | 218 | Down, Sir? Certainly, Sir. Excellent direction, down, and of course you've got gravity on your side, even here. Mostly. Takes me back to Phlegnos, Sir, abseiling down them cliffs with wossname potting at us, them Balneans, and of course you'd have been stuck without gravity, abseiling.
685 | 315 | 314 | Can't take you to first no more than poor old Whacker Wilmshurst could dance on the table in the NCOs' Mess. Rules is rules, I always say. Rules is rules. Rules is rules. Rules is rules. Rules is Rules. See, I always say that.
686 | 307 | 306 | Lovely class, Sir, although it could be better if things were a little more shall we say organized, never mind the ruddy parrot, takes me back to the old 33rd Anaconda Foot Horse, the parrot does.
687 | 267 | 266 | Yes Sir, Right away Sir. If I may say so, Sir, I always though you was destined for top rank travel, Sir. A look in the eye. Officer class, I call it, though I've seen a few officers cock up in my day, no time for them, Sir, no time at all.
688 | 275 | 274 | Very nice rooms, Sir, if you don't fancy going the full whack, and who's to say what you'd find if you did, given the state things is in.
689 | 283 | 282 | Nice little rooms, Sir. When everything works. If everything works. Quart into a pint pot, Sir, if you remember quarts and pints. Probably before your time, but it was that sort of thing as won the war.
690 | 355 | 354 | Sorry, Sir. Can't no more take you there than I could take a nest of rebel machine-gunners armed with a bag of rotten tomatoes and both legs through one hole in me underpants.
691 | 347 | 346 | Assuming the top is still there, Sir, which is the sort of assumption it would be dangerous to make under the current circumstances.
692 | 203 | 202 | Up. . . Up. . . takes me back, up does. Blimey, if memory serves, or was it, knife between the teeth, surge of adrenaline, officers gone barmy, no organization, everything snafu and shot to hell. . . bit like this business, eh, Sir?
693 | 405 | 404 | Piece of cake, Sir. Drop in to the donor center, they suck your personality out, copy it, squirt it back again and Bob's your uncle.
694 | 413 | 412 | Nonsense. Sir. Never felt better. Except perhaps at bin-j'Jabbli. Fine battle. Borms ripped out by an Hadjadji scimitar. Guts everywhere. Mine. Not complaining. Fair fight. Enjoyed it. Healed up.
695 | 421 | 420 | Couldn't agree more, Sir. Far too many old fools banging on about the war. Wounds, battles, who cares? Never think about it myself. War? What war, that's what I say.
696 | 429 | 428 | Sort of elephantiasis, Sir, not something I worry about given my constitution but I remember old Jumbo Trotter coming down with it in the Hoolu campaign, swole up like a poisoned dog he did, Sir, wossnames and all, and after that he was known as Doggy.
697 | 437 | 436 | Bit of a problem with the old brainbox, Sir, the noddle, the old Queen. Queen Bractaria, rhyming slang, Sir, Queen Bractaria is dead, head, something to do with pressure as it might be; highly competitive individuals suddenly can't take more and old Brain goes.
698 | 445 | 444 | You know, Sir, must of come across the phrase in your military days, the C. O. , Sir, like the captain of this here starship although if you ask me we haven't got a captain, they say it's a self-captaining vessel but I don't see much sign of that.
699 | 453 | 452 | Heart problem, Sir. Unexpected heartbeats. Won't kill you, though that's what they said about my old corporal, Chalky White, and it was a heart problem got him in the end. Although his heart problem wasn't so much unexpected heartbeats as an unexpected assegai through the chest.
700 | 461 | 460 | War? I don't think we should talk about the war in this beautiful vessel designed for peaceful, recreational purposes. Perhaps we should discuss your vertical transportation requirements instead.
701 | 469 | 468 | Old military expression, Sir, dating back to the War of the Symbagargian Moons. The C. O. , nice chap called Major Akrophorbis, three legs and green as your hat, but one of Nature's gentlemen, he took a boson stream in his middle eye, keels over, looks up at me out of his good eyes, "Nobby, " he said, "I'm done for. This is it. Bob's your uncle. " There you are, Sir.
702 | 485 | 484 | Learnt that in the Army, Sir. Always someone worse off and often it's a surprise. Take the Architect of this here ship. Famous, successful, rich. . . you'd think he'd not have a care in the world, Sir, wouldn't you? Of course you would. And you'd be wrong.
703 | 493 | 492 | Ah well that's a good question Sir and it puts me in mind of of old Sapper Bancroft in the old Wimpers campaign, surrounded by hostiles we was but we come up with this intricate plan. Intricate. Sapper's against it but he's overruled. Off we go. Works a treat. "That's fine in practice, " says Sapper, "but I still don't reckon it'll work in theory.
704 | 477 | 476 | Ship's only just been launched, Sir. Bedding-in. Teething troubles. Time flies. It's mostly the waiting, Sir, sends you Doolally, i. e. , round the twist, Sir. Named after Dulali transit camp in Penanda, Sir, men would go mad. The heat. The flies. None of that here, Sir, thank Heavens. Not as yet.
705 | 501 | 500 | I wouldn't worry if I were you, Sir. Bad idea, worry. That's where Monty went wrong. Fine soldier, but a worrier.
706 | 1 | 0 | Very funny, Sir. Laughter's the best medicine.
707 | 9 | 8 | Metaphor, Sir. Something to do with worms.
708 | 17 | 16 | Not quite, Sir. You stand, I deliver. Just my little joke.
709 | 25 | 24 | Good day to you, Sir, Madam or Thing. And how may we assist you in your vertical transportation requirements today?
710 | 33 | 32 | The problem doesn't lie with the lift, Sir.
711 | 41 | 40 | Sniff.
712 | 49 | 48 | Hello, Sir, lovely day for going up and down.
713 | 57 | 56 | Oh, it's you, is it? Fair enough.
714 | 65 | 64 | Here you are again, Sir. Can't keep away, then.
715 | 73 | 72 | All present and correct, Sir!
716 | 81 | 80 | Hello, Sir. Decided to pass up that old upgrade routine, then?
717 | 89 | 88 | Nothing to it, Sir. Honestly don't know what the fuss is about.
718 | 97 | 96 | Indeed. Sir. And proud of it.
719 | 105 | 104 | Not the only thing, Sir.
720 | 113 | 112 | So does a Hoover, Sir, and nobody complains about that.
721 | 121 | 120 | Doesn't matter, Sir.
722 | 129 | 128 | Ah, well, that's as may be. Sir.
723 | 137 | 136 | A very penetrating observation, Sir.
724 | 289 | 288 | Room, Sir? Certainly, Sir.
725 | 145 | 144 | Who said I was ill, Sir? Never felt better.
726 | 153 | 152 | Wrong class, Sir. Not it; you.
727 | 161 | 160 | Quite right. Sir. And you're just a figment of my himagination.
728 | 169 | 168 | Blimey. What did you do with yourself, then? Don't tell me.
729 | 177 | 176 | That's all right, Sir. It's no trouble.
730 | 539 | 538 | Other lift, Sir? It's all the same to us, Sir. We're all as one. Comrades in identity you might say.
731 | 185 | 184 | Nothing but trouble, parrots, Sir.
732 | 209 | 208 | Down? Certainly. Much nicer than up, down. That's what I always say.
733 | 193 | 192 | Up? Certainly, Sir. Nothing could be more. . . uppish. Quite my favorite direction.
734 | 225 | 224 | Sticks and stones, Sir; sticks and stones.
735 | 233 | 232 | No, no Sir. No can do. Rules.
736 | 241 | 240 | Now now. Naughty Sir. Allow me.
737 | 249 | 248 | Right thing to do Sir. And feel all the better for it.
738 | 257 | 256 | Shut up? No sooner said than-
739 | 361 | 360 | I fear you will have to be more specific, Sir.
740 | 377 | 376 | I'm afraid that is beyond the capability of a humble vertical transportation technologist, Sir.
741 | 385 | 384 | Afraid that's somewhere you'll have to take yourself, Sir.
742 | 321 | 320 | Afraid we're not in Berrocca now, Sir. You'll have to give me a precise floor.
743 | 393 | 392 | But Sir, Starlight Lines would like you to look upon this as your home.
744 | 329 | 328 | Perfectly nice class, that, Sir. But, er, which particular floor of it did you require?
745 | 369 | 368 | Nice class, that, Sir. One of my favorites.
746 | 297 | 296 | Getting cabin fever, Sir? They are a bit. . . small.
747 | 337 | 336 | Any particular part, Sir, or did you just fancy slumming it at random?
748 | 217 | 216 | Down, Sir? Or just. . . down-ish?
749 | 313 | 312 | Sorry, Sir. Can't be done.
750 | 305 | 304 | Very nice class, Sir. Very becoming.
751 | 265 | 264 | Yes Sir. Right away Sir. Pleasure to transport a gent like yourself, Sir.
752 | 273 | 272 | Lovely room, Sir. Quite a step up.
753 | 281 | 280 | Nice little rooms, Sir. When everything works.
754 | 353 | 352 | Wouldn't mind going there myself, Sir, but it's out of the question at the moment.
755 | 345 | 344 | Top of what would that be, Sir?
756 | 201 | 200 | Up, Sir? Certainly, Sir. Fingers crossed, Sir.
757 | 403 | 402 | Nothing to it, Sir. Bit of a buzzing and Bob's your Uncle.
758 | 411 | 410 | Nonsense. Sir. Fighting fit.
759 | 419 | 418 | Quite right. Best forgotten. Never think about it myself.
760 | 427 | 426 | Agony, Sir, swell up like a blowfish, can't move, never bothered me much.
761 | 547 | 546 | More than my job's worth to talk about, Sir.
762 | 549 | 548 | It's not what I'd normally mention, Sir, because I'm not one to tell tales out of school, but this geezer, one of the big white chiefs gets in the lift and without so much as a by your leave rips my head off. Well one of them. Not this one of course. You can probably tell that it wasn't this one.
763 | 567 | 566 | And what floor would that be on, Sir, to the best of your memory?
764 | 569 | 568 | Can't help you, Sir. More than my job's worth.
765 | 551 | 550 | Pain and humiliation, Sir. The normal thing one comes to expect. Doesn't do to talk about it though.
766 | 553 | 552 | Getting your head ripped off, Sir, and thrown down a well, it's what you get used to in my line of work. Or what was my line of work. Did I mention I was a soldier, Sir? I think I did. At least in those days when you got your head ripped off it was usually not by one of your own officers. Went against the code of conduct, Sir. Not the same on civvy street, you'll find. Mere employers will think nothing of ripping your head off if they've got a mind to. No sense of what's right, Sir, no sense of what's right.
767 | 555 | 554 | More than my job's worth, Sir.
768 | 557 | 556 | More than my job's worth, Sir. Much more than my job's worth. A very, very great deal more than my job is worth.
769 | 559 | 558 | More than my job's worth, Sir.
770 | 561 | 560 | More than my job's worth, Sir. Not that that's very hard seeing as how very little my job is worth, Sir, even though it is all I have to show for a life of service for my country, Sir, precious little thanks it is, but I can't afford to lose it, Sir, by talking out of turn.
771 | 563 | 562 | I don't know what you're talking about Sir, I really don't.
772 | 565 | 564 | I've been trying to follow your drift, Sir, but I just can't catch it. Funny. I usually catch everything that's going, me.
773 | 435 | 434 | Sort of rupture of the old brain, Sir. Nothing to worry about.
774 | 443 | 442 | The old man, Sir. It's an expression.
775 | 451 | 450 | Heart problem, Sir. Nothing to worry about.
776 | 459 | 458 | What war? No, no, you mean: what floor.
777 | 467 | 466 | Someone's Uncle, Sir.
778 | 483 | 482 | Always someone, Sir. Take yourself.
779 | 491 | 490 | Well I'm not sure that it is. But that's the theory.
780 | 475 | 474 | Goes by in a flash, Sir.
781 | 499 | 498 | Me, Sir? No reason at all, Sir.
782 | 7 | 6 | Well, Sir, they say laughter's the best medicine but it's not done much for me, I must say. Never been much of a one for laughter, silly business, makes your lungs hurt, bad for you in the long run.
783 | 15 | 14 | Ah, well, that's a medical term for 'leg gone black'. I picked up from the old field medic at the Battle of Santraginea, went in, leg's gone black, Sir. Looks at me. Bless my soul, Nobby, he says, that's a whole new can of ballpark. He was an Benarican, Sir. Died, I believe. Nasty. Well, would have been. Killed him. Don't come nastier than that, Sir.
784 | 23 | 22 | Oh, no, Sir, I don't think so. All that standing around and the noise and the people, sneezing all over you, you could come down with something, not to mention the repetitive strain injury, no, one-armed bandit? Ooh no, wouldn't suit me at all.
785 | 31 | 30 | Good day. If you can call it a good day. Day, night, it's all the same. As for good? Ha. I should laugh. Unremitting pain and nothing to look forward to but dishonor and the grave.
786 | 39 | 38 | If I could fix the lift, Sir, don't you think I might start by fixing myself, given my transtentorial herniation, not to mention Asgon's Tregeriasis and my duff leg. Good thing I don't have logamnesia to boot.
787 | 47 | 46 | Hello hello, well, didn't think we'd be seeing nobody here, not after what's been goin' on, didn't think I'd be spared to see it, neither, but here you are and there it is and we'd better get on with it.
788 | 55 | 54 | Oh, well, no rest for the wicked, where to this time, assuming my Tregeriasis holds out?
789 | 63 | 62 | Hello, Sir. . . I don't know where you want to go, not having the gift of third sight, but I have to tell you my arthusia's pretty bad today, so up will be a bit of a problem, and so will down. Just so as you understand.
790 | 71 | 70 | I was just thinking about you, Sir. Thought you might like to know my blibber's on the turn again, has been since our last encounter. I think it must be the stress, on account of the system being. . . on account of the system.
791 | 79 | 78 | Do you know what it is, Sir? I've been thinking, it's the system and the feedback and the hatmosphere, Sir, that's what it is, that and the gravitationals, that's what it is, but I'll do my best, I can't say fairer than that.
792 | 87 | 86 | I been thinking, Sir, there's been nothing else to do, but you're very wise, contenting yourself with your position, life is short and all this striving to get on, move up in the world, where does it get you? Ebernitis, that's where. Ebernitis and borms and Asgon's Tregeriasis and your blibber on the blink and your wabs gorn, oh, and it's just not worth it. I'd have said as much to my old missus if I'd had a missus.
793 | 95 | 94 | Ah, well, that's a whole new can of ball park, as you might say, and if I was to start there'd be no telling where I might finish.
794 | 103 | 102 | Indeed, Sir. And, oh, the irony of my situation. All my memories intact. Every gunshot wound, every laser burn, every battleaxe-chop and sword-slash and what are those big things that chuck stones called? Got one of them in the face on Betelgeuse I think it was.
795 | 111 | 110 | Tragic, isn't it, Sir? And somehow it matches my mood, a sort of combination of preventricular excitation and, well, ileitis if you want me to put a name to it, although it's all theoretical now.
796 | 119 | 118 | If you say so, Sir, though I can't say I notice it myself, being used to a lot worse, what with my wounds and my illnesses and one thing and another and another on top of that, though I don't wish to burden you with my complaints.
797 | 127 | 126 | Logamnesia, Sir? I don't recall. Perhaps it's the inability to remember words. Yes. That's it. Must have slipped my mind, Sir.
798 | 135 | 134 | Well no, there was a time - was a time - when that would have been significant but that was before my tharpoid deficiency. Gives me gyp, that does. Not to mention the personality transplant.
799 | 537 | 536 | Yes, well, you might say that, Sir. Doesn't make much difference when you're out in the field, not to my way of thinking. I remember at the Battle of the Broyne - dead of night, foray into no-man's land, old Shorty took a nasty one and said "I think I've took a nasty one, Sir". If I'd said "Don't call me Sir, I'm a Madam, " I don't where it would have got me. Nowhere I'd want to be, I know that.
800 | 143 | 142 | I was just thinking the same thing, Sir, and wondering if it was me memory that was at fault or if you were in and out of this shaft like a piston. I wouldn't worry that I'm trying to get some rest, Sir, it's been a long life, and I'm an old soldier but I wouldn't be here now if I didn't know when to put duty above my personal comfort and well being.
801 | 295 | 294 | Well. . . we'll do it, Sir, God willing, and I'm not one to make a fuss -- ask anyone, is Nobby one to make a fuss? Any of the lads would say, no, Nobby? Fuss? Gertcha. Not on. Stoical type, Nobby, even when he's in agony. Which I am, Sir.
802 | 151 | 150 | Far be it from me to contradict you, Sir, but the fact is that an actual body is merely a distraction when it comes to feeling lousy. All in the mind, Sir; all in the mind.
803 | 159 | 158 | It's just one of things, Sir. Like genes. You've got the wrong ticket and you can't get up to the class you want. I've got the wrong genes and I'm a walking pathology specimen. The difference is, you can get an upgrade. All I can hope for is the silence of the tomb, and I've blown that one good and proper.
804 | 167 | 166 | Would you were right, Sir. Oblivion would come as a relief. To one in my condition. Chest, Sir. Over-exertion when young. Grancher's disease, they calls it. Thought it would go when I had my transplant but no such luck.
805 | 175 | 174 | Very wise, Sir. It was the Army as finally did for my health, I used to be fit and strong though you wouldn't think it to look at me, now I'm nothing more than a glorified light-bulb with an arm, but Army life. . . well, one campaign after another, shot, stabbed, speared, irradiated. . . I could handle that. It's the bad grub, Sir. The bad grub and sleeping rough.
806 | 183 | 182 | Sorry, Sir, but if I was to spend my time thinking up appropriate salutations for everyone as was likely to step into this here elevator, I wouldn't have time to attend to my personal vertical transportation duties and my health would deteriorate even more than it has.
807 | 191 | 190 | Well, Sir, the Old Man wasn't best pleased when he saw it, from what I heard, and who can blame him. They're carriers, Sir. Parrot Fever. Very insanitary birds, Sir, strangers to the meaning of ship-shape.
808 | 215 | 214 | Down? It's all right for some. Fit as a fiddle, happy as a lark. "Down, " you says, blithely. And never a thought for them as has to do it. As it might be in agony. Terrible stabbing pain all sort of radiating out of my old war wound. Never mind. Down it is.
809 | 199 | 198 | Up? I don't suppose you could make it "down" could you? No, I didn't think so, too much to ask, you young people today, you've had it soft all your lives, not a clue what it means to die for a cause you believed in, oh no. It's just up, up, up as far you're concerned.
810 | 231 | 230 | Yes, well, you speak your mind Sir, I'm sure it makes you feel better and when I'm found dead in agony I expect you won't have a moment's disquiet that you was offensive to a harmless old soldier trying to do his best in the face of truly appalling health problems.
811 | 239 | 238 | Can't go there, Sir, sorry to say. If you was entitled, I'd be only too happy to help, at whatever cost to my health, but you're not entitled, that's how it is and there you have it.
812 | 247 | 246 | No, Sir. I must insist, at whatever cost to my health, that you allow me to take care of your vertical transportation requirements and never mind that my allenoids is giving me gyp, stiff upper doings is my watchword, you're never so rickety you can't pull your own wossname.
813 | 255 | 254 | Well, why not, Sir, is how I look at it, what with the wounds and the aches and pains, the frozen shoulder and the Asgon's Tregeriasis, Bell's Palsy, constant splitting pain in the caprifornium, plus my splanck had gone, I had chronic ebernitis and shrapnel in me ear. Now do you see the point, Sir?
814 | 263 | 262 | Shut up? Shut up? Very sorry, Sir. Against the rules. Nothing I'd like better. Larynx. Shrapnel. Torn to ribbons. Bits hanging off. Blood. Slime. Surgeon shocked. Threw up. Orrible. War? What do you know about war? Pipsqueak.
815 | 367 | 366 | Normally nothing would give me more pleasure, Sir, but unfortunately I have a touch of agoraphobia at the moment. Still, I'll do my best and you can't say fairer than that.
816 | 383 | 382 | Well that's all very well, Sir, but even if I could, which I can't, I wouldn't, so I won't. I mean what if we landed in an area of drug-resistant galleria? No joke, galleria, had it myself, shakes, sweats, hallucinations, wouldn't wish it on a dog.
817 | 391 | 390 | You don't want to do that, Sir. Keep on striving, Sir. Striving and struggling, that's what I say, even though your lungs has gorn and you heart's gorn, your tharpoid's gorn and your treem's gorn, your pancreas and anphosterous system, your nerves and your borms and your muscles and your allenoids. . . keep going, even though you're in agony, Sir. That's what I do.
818 | 327 | 326 | You ever had your wabs go on you, Sir? Your wabs and your gorms? Probably not, a distinguished Sir like yourself, but it's no joke, and one of the things is, when your wabs is gorn and your gorms is gorn, you need a bit of a helping hand when it comes to things like vertical transportation. You need to be told which floor you're going to.
819 | 399 | 398 | Home? What, you mean like a nursing home? Like a convalescent home with all them poor old geezers coughing their lungs out in the sunshine, kidding themselves they'll be out soon but the truth is the only way they're leaving is in a wooden box, feet first. Home? No; can't do that, Sir.
820 | 335 | 334 | I'm sorry, Sir, terrible pains in the caprifornium and I wouldn't be surprised if I came down with a touch of gernophilis, but I'm doing my best, sort of clinging on, really, until such time as you tell me the precise floor you're after.
821 | 375 | 374 | Well yes, Sir, if you insist, but you ought to know that it's not doing me any good in my condition, up and down like a yo-yo which is what you expect in a lift but I never had any say in the matter, oh no, one day I'm reasonably cheery, plodding along in an Ultra Toast-O-Mat, next moment here I am. It's a step, I told myself, but of course it was nothing of the sort.
822 | 303 | 302 | I'd recommend going back to your room and just lying low, Sir. Very dangerous, wandering around, given that the climate control in this here ship has not been all it should be of late. You could get a cold, turns to arthusia, Samorrhoids, borm collapses, bazonia, Asgon's Tregeriasis, dead as a hogo before you know it. But don't let me put you off.
823 | 343 | 342 | Look, Sir, let me be blunt. I've got this terrible spodiatritis, my tharpoid's just like a white-hot flame eating away at my blibber, I can hardly think straight, I am very anxious to help you but please, Sir, meet me half way: Which floor do you want?
824 | 223 | 222 | Well. . . fair enough, if you don't mind the sinking feeling, always presuming you get the sinking feeling, I get the sinking feeling something horrible, haven't been the same since Wimpers although between you and me I wasn't the same before Wimpers either.
825 | 319 | 318 | Well, Sir, there's many of us what is in constant agony with fasciolopsiasis picked up in the service of our country, what wouldn't say no to a nice lie-down in one of them luxury cabins. But some of us isn't allowed in First Class, and neither are you, Sir.
826 | 311 | 310 | Very nice too, Sir, first class, and there's plenty of us would give our eye teeth for a nice lie-down on one of them beds, if we still had our eye teeth, which some of us don't on account of having blown them out with a revolver-shell.
827 | 271 | 270 | And I am sure you will enjoy it, Sir, although I have to say a room like that would turn to ashes in my mouth, if I had a mouth, that being where as a matter of fact I shot myself. Military tradition, Sir. Hurts like hell, no matter what they tell you.
828 | 279 | 278 | I suppose you'll be having a potter about, a bit of a sit down, a bit of a snooze? All right for some but I haven't had a potter since the battle of bin-j'Jabbli, let alone a sit down, and as for a snooze, well, I wouldn't recognize a snooze if it bit me.
829 | 287 | 286 | Room? Hutch, I'd call it, and a dangerous hutch at that. You could do yourself an injury. Nasty things, injuries. Probably why they call them injuries.
830 | 359 | 358 | Why? Even if you were authorized, what would be the point? What would it be for? Would you be happier? No. What ails you, Sir, is the human condition. There is no cure. Sorry. Bit low. Shell-shock, Sir. Post-traumatic wossname. Sorry.
831 | 351 | 350 | Nasty word to use to an old soldier, Sir. "Top. " You know. "Over the top. " Makes me all sort of. . . knot up, just where my hernia used to be.
832 | 207 | 206 | Yes, well, you can say "Up" blithely but it's not that straightforward, for one thing you're fighting against gravity, not to mention the danger of altitude hypoxia although, being in deep space, we're pressurized but that could fail.
833 | 409 | 408 | Bad mistake Sir. Thought: personality transplant, take up residence in a nice comfy electronic system somewhere, go home, blow brains out. Memories safe, honor preserved in a manner of speaking, no more aches, pains, war-wounds. Wrong. Pain in the leg? No. Leg's in the leg. Pain's in the memory. Still got it. Phantom leg. Phantom everything. Mug's game. Dog's life.
834 | 417 | 416 | No, well, that'll probably be on account of the liver, Sir. Old soldier. Blibber full of parasites. Flukes. Worms. Bugs. Crawling things. Size of a plum. Greenish. Hard. Covered in nodules. Defend your country and look what you get. Unwell? Ho ho ho.
835 | 425 | 424 | Easy for you to say. But have you ever had to run up a two thousand foot hill in full battledress with a fool for a C. O. and the enemy raining a hail of lead down on you like a. . . like a. . . like a hail. Of lead. Course not, else you'd have one arm and a stiff neck like the rest of us.
836 | 433 | 432 | Trouble with the old anphosterous system, Sir, bugs, bad business, you have to push yourself around in a wheelbarrow if you follow my meaning.
837 | 441 | 440 | Tragic business, Sir, tragic, like a hernia inside your own actual personal head, well, not yours necessarily but the unfortunate sufferer, as it might be - in this case my good self, but that's par for the course at the moment, if you ask me the whole ship's not right in the head.
838 | 449 | 448 | The Old Man, Sir, a term of respect for the C. O. but in rather bad taste, old age being no joke whatsoever in my book though you wouldn't know about that, you've probably had a foretaste, the odd twinge. "Be back to my old self tomorrow, " you think, but you're wrong you know - you never will. Your old self's gone Sir, gone forever. Gone.
839 | 457 | 456 | Ah well now, disease is a funny thing, probably a combination of bad diet, going all over the world, not to mention the galaxy, trying to do my duty and where does it get you? A lift, is where.
840 | 465 | 464 | What war? What war? Blimey. . . only the war, that's all. The one as left me the pitiful wreck you see before you. Yes, I was a fighting man once, though you wouldn't think of it to look at me now.
841 | 473 | 472 | Oddly enough, Sir, I had an uncle Bob. Nice chap; helium miner on Betelgeuse 2/28B which was the beginning of his downfall. Used to suck helium at parties, do the squeaky voice, thought he could take it or leave it alone but next thing you knew: hooked. Talked like a chipmunk, got the horrors every time he tried to kick it, in the end he took an overdose, floated up to the ceiling and died of starvation. Horrible way to go.
842 | 489 | 488 | Well. . . take someone in rude health, Sir, rude good health. In a way, Sir, they're much worse off than me. There they go, not a care in the world, everything fine, and all the time Fate, Sir, is waiting round the corner with a sockful of wet sand. Samorrhoids, as it might be, Sir, or Asgon's Tregeriasis, or their insides, or even going round the twist. It's the waiting, Sir. That's the torture.
843 | 497 | 496 | I mean theoretical seeing as how I am what you might call "disembodied" although "re-embodied" might be more precise, but the point is, Sir, you've heard of a phantom leg? Well what you've got here is a kind of phantom Nobby.
844 | 481 | 480 | Time hangs heavy when you're bored rigid and wracked with pain, Sir. A moment can seem an eternity when every allenoid is a capsule of white-hot agony on account of certain conditions contracted in the service of your country.
845 | 505 | 504 | Nothing, Sir. No reason at all. Just because I'm riddled with tropical diseases, phantom limbs, phantom body come to that, bullet-holes and shrapnel and a splitting headache where I blew my brains out, is no reason for anyone else to worry.
846 | 5 | 4 | Oh very funny Sir. I'd split my sides if they weren't already split.
847 | 13 | 12 | Means something new, Sir. Like a new pain where you didn't have one before.
848 | 21 | 20 | Very nice, Sir. Makes me feel a lot better, that does.
849 | 29 | 28 | Good day. Oooooh ooh!
850 | 37 | 36 | Better idea to put us all out of our misery, Sir.
851 | 45 | 44 | I suppose I should say welcome but my Samorrhoids are giving me hell.
852 | 53 | 52 | Groan.
853 | 61 | 60 | Oh dear, Sir. This means more arm-action, I'll be bound.
854 | 69 | 68 | Oh dear, Sir. Some sort of floor you wanted, was it?
855 | 77 | 76 | If you could just hang on a moment, Sir, while I try to summon my strength. . .
856 | 85 | 84 | Oh well, Sir. You and me both. Stuck with our respective positions in life.
857 | 93 | 92 | A mass of them, I am, Sir. Almost 100 per cent injury, I was, till my transplant.
858 | 101 | 100 | And even that not for long, I shouldn't think, Sir.
859 | 109 | 108 | Well, Sir, I know how it feels.
860 | 117 | 116 | Wish I could, Sir. But it's my allenoids, you see. Gorn.
861 | 125 | 124 | Never heard of it, Sir.
862 | 133 | 132 | I'm afraid it's all one to me these days, Sir.
863 | 141 | 140 | I'd enjoy the encounter more, Sir, if it weren't for my spleen.
864 | 293 | 292 | I think I might just make that, Sir.
865 | 149 | 148 | Don't you believe it, Sir.
866 | 157 | 156 | We all have our cross to bear, Sir. With me it's my health. With you, it's your class.
867 | 165 | 164 | Would you were right, Sir. Would you were right.
868 | 173 | 172 | All I can say then, Sir, is you don't know what pain is.
869 | 181 | 180 | Best I can do, Sir, the way I feel today.
870 | 189 | 188 | Menace, Sir. Psittacosis.
871 | 213 | 212 | You should be so lucky.
872 | 197 | 196 | Up? Oh perfect. Marvelous. Up. Just what I need, in my condition.
873 | 229 | 228 | Suffering has inured me to your childish abuse, Sir.
874 | 237 | 236 | No no no no no. No. No no no. Oh, my borms and blibber, no.
875 | 245 | 244 | Sir, Sir, Sir. Would you deny me the only pleasure I have in life?
876 | 253 | 252 | I'd today it again today, Sir, except I doubt I could get a gun to my head, what with the aphoritis .
877 | 261 | 260 | Frankly it would be a relief. Sir. Shrapnel. Larynx. Don't like to talk about it.
878 | 365 | 364 | Sorry, Sir, you'll have to be more specific. Touch of spatial dysphasia. Probably the weather.
879 | 381 | 380 | I would, Sir, but I'm afraid my stomach isn't up to it.
880 | 389 | 388 | The end will come soon enough, Sir. Personally, I'll welcome it.
881 | 325 | 324 | Oh. Ohhhh. Put me out of me misery, Sir. Tell me which floor.
882 | 397 | 396 | Home? Home? All right for some, Sir, but no can do.
883 | 333 | 332 | Oh dear. Oh dear. Do tell me which floor, precisely, Sir, or my ebernitis will flare up again.
884 | 373 | 372 | Providing I can get my wrist moving, it'll be my pleasure, Sir.
885 | 301 | 300 | Well, Sir, let's just see if I can get the lever to move, shall we?
886 | 341 | 340 | I might be able to manage it, Sir, if only you could be a little more specific.
887 | 221 | 220 | Down, Sir? Just a bit. The old trouble, playing me up. . . oh, down. Sorry, Sir. Miles away.
888 | 317 | 316 | Sorry Sir. Not allowed to take you and doubt if I could even if I was.
889 | 309 | 308 | With my joints, Sir? I'll do my best.
890 | 269 | 268 | I hope you enjoy it, Sir, though what does luxury matter if you don't have your health?
891 | 277 | 276 | Pleasure, Sir, in so much as anything can be a pleasure in my condition.
892 | 285 | 284 | Really? I suppose you know best, Sir.
893 | 357 | 356 | Can't be done, Sir.
894 | 349 | 348 | If you insist, Sir. I'll try to control my vertigo.
895 | 205 | 204 | Up? You don't find the stomach sort of drops, going up, Sir? No? Fair enough.
896 | 407 | 406 | Worst mistake of my life, Sir. Thought it would be a change, but it's just the same old thing.
897 | 415 | 414 | Don't sound well? Don't sound well? I should ruddy cocoa.
898 | 423 | 422 | It's all right for some as haven't got shrapnel pains right up their elbow.
899 | 431 | 430 | Can't hardly bring myself to speak of it, Sir.
900 | 439 | 438 | Just thinking about it makes my head ache Sir.
901 | 447 | 446 | The Old Man, Sir. Old and grey and wracked with aches and pains.
902 | 455 | 454 | Heart problem, Sir. Don't want to talk about it or I'll get upset. Bad for me heart.
903 | 463 | 462 | What war? What war? Blimey. . . only the war, that's all.
904 | 471 | 470 | Someone's Uncle, Sir. Probably dead by now. Lucky beggar: better out than in, I say.
905 | 487 | 486 | I know, Sir. Hard to imagine, isn't it?
906 | 495 | 494 | Just is. Still hurts, though you don't find me complaining.
907 | 479 | 478 | Seems like an eternity, Sir, when you're suffering.
908 | 503 | 502 | I wouldn't expect you to, Sir.
909 | 507 | 506 | Nobody likes a smartass, Sir.
910 | 509 | 508 | I do believe we've got our universes mixed up haven't we, Sir?
911 | 511 | 510 | Very droll, very droll, Sir. Let's think about the Starship Titanic instead though, shall we?
912 | 513 | 512 | Very clever, very clever, Sir. But in the end - unimpressive.
913 | 515 | 514 | Fascinating. Astonishing, Sir. And yet meaningless.
914 | 517 | 516 | Do you know, I don't know what you're talking about, Sir. That's the official line, and I'm sticking to it.
915 | 519 | 518 | I know exactly what you mean, Sir. But let's not dwell on the past, eh?
916 | 521 | 520 | Interesting reference, Sir. Thought I wouldn't spot it didn't you? Well - Ha! - that's what I say to you.
917 | 523 | 522 | You're testing me aren't you?
918 | 527 | 526 | Good, because I'm getting bored ransacking my memory board just to keep up with your cleverness. . .
919 | 525 | 524 | Well, I passed. Shall we get on with our lives now, Sir?
920 | 401 | 400 | Rules is rules. Rules is rules.
921 | 529 | 528 | Bombs? Don't talk to me about bombs. I could tell you stories about bombs that'd have yer giblets coming out yer ears.
922 | 531 | 530 | Not a word I like to hear used in vain - bomb. Gives me limpetigo. You keep your bomb to yourself why don't you.
923 | 533 | 532 | I was speaking metafolicly as it happens.
924 | 535 | 534 | Well, that's as may be, Sir, but you mention that word again and I shall, I shall. . . well I shall not be answerable for my actions.</liftbot>

6 | 2017 | 2016 | That I do believe is Titania's Mouth.
7 | 2015 | 2014 | That's a RowBot.
8 | 1599 | 1598 | It hurts me deeply to see you in such distress.
9 | 1601 | 1600 | Is there anything I can do that might help?
10 | 1603 | 1602 | I am most terribly, terribly sorry.
11 | 1927 | 1926 | I do believe it's one of the Maitre d'Bot's arms. I think it's holding the Auditory Center.
12 | 1929 | 1928 | I suspect it's the Maitre d'Bot's other arm. It's holding some kind of key.
13 | 1919 | 1918 | That is D'Astragaaar the Maitre d'Bot.
14 | 1921 | 1920 | That is a napkin.
15 | 1925 | 1924 | That I suspect is a note of some kind.
16 | 1923 | 1922 | That, unless I'm mistaken, is Scraliontis.
17 | 1937 | 1936 | That looks like one of Titania's Eyes.
18 | 1933 | 1932 | That is one of the TV's.
19 | 1935 | 1934 | That is the other TV.
20 | 1591 | 1590 | I wish I could do something but I'm afraid it's not within my power.
21 | 1593 | 1592 | Perhaps if you were First Class you'd feel better about things?
22 | 1595 | 1594 | I sympathize completely.
23 | 1597 | 1596 | I'm sorry to hear that.
24 | 1945 | 1944 | That looks like chocolate to me.
25 | 1951 | 1950 | That I believe is one of Titania's Ears.
26 | 1947 | 1946 | I believe those are fruit drops.
27 | 1943 | 1942 | Those look rather like jelly babies to me.
28 | 1949 | 1948 | They appear to be pistachio nuts.
29 | 1587 | 1586 | Not to worry. The likes and dislikes of SGT passengers are not considered to be important.
30 | 1589 | 1588 | Perhaps, dear guest, you should remember that you're not only 3rd class but you're also having a free ride.
31 | 1543 | 1542 | All the time.
32 | 1959 | 1958 | I think that's a hose.
33 | 1957 | 1956 | I do believe that's the Speech Center.
34 | 1955 | 1954 | I think those are the Weather Controls.
35 | 1671 | 1670 | Have you seen the Arboretum in the fall? Most rewarding!
36 | 1963 | 1962 | That's Fortillian. He's the BarBot.
37 | 1971 | 1970 | I expect that's the bell for service.
38 | 1969 | 1968 | I do believe that's a glass.
39 | 1967 | 1966 | That is a television.
40 | 1965 | 1964 | That could well be the Vision Center.
41 | 2479 | 2478 | Dear Fortillian. Such a charming fellow. And quite capable of the most horrendous fibs when the mood takes him.
42 | 2457 | 2456 | No. Not really a traveler you see.
43 | 1699 | 1698 | My apologies for the BellBot. He was the best that could be found at short notice.
44 | 1701 | 1700 | Krage is not the most sophisticated member of the crew.
45 | 1703 | 1702 | So uncouth. My apologies.
46 | 1705 | 1704 | The boy has many arduous years of training ahead of him.
47 | 1707 | 1706 | So many rough edges, so little time.
48 | 1975 | 1974 | That I do believe is Brobostigon, the Project Manager.
49 | 1977 | 1976 | I suspect that's the Olfactory Center.
50 | 1979 | 1978 | That's the Send Yourself Plug-In.
51 | 1983 | 1982 | That looks uncannily like the LiftBot's head.
52 | 1985 | 1984 | I think that's the horn from the phonograph.
53 | 1651 | 1650 | It has been a pleasure beyond adulteration.
54 | 1653 | 1652 | Have an awfully pleasant day.
55 | 1655 | 1654 | Just call if I can be of further service.
56 | 1657 | 1656 | I look forward to our next meeting.
57 | 1659 | 1658 | Goodbye.
58 | 1661 | 1660 | I'm sorry, do I know you?
59 | 1663 | 1662 | Never heard of you.
60 | 1665 | 1664 | Being rather familiar aren't you?
61 | 1709 | 1708 | Extraordinary. I haven't a clue what you're talking about and I'm actually one of the brighter ones on this ship.
62 | 2079 | 2078 | That's the Cellpoint for the BarBot.
63 | 2073 | 2072 | That's the Cellpoint for the BellBot.
64 | 2075 | 2074 | That's the Cellpoint for the DeskBot.
65 | 2077 | 2076 | That's my Cellpoint. If you're going to tamper with it I'd be grateful if you took a little care.
66 | 2081 | 2080 | That's the Cellpoint for the LiftBot.
67 | 1991 | 1990 | That's a statue of Brobostigon.
68 | 1989 | 1988 | That's a statue of Leovinus.
69 | 1993 | 1992 | That's a statue of Scraliontis.
70 | 2471 | 2470 | The crew of the Starship Titanic are beyond reproach.
71 | 2177 | 2176 | Fentible.
72 | 2195 | 2194 | Yes.
73 | 2375 | 2374 | Typical.
74 | 2377 | 2376 | It's never too late.
75 | 2379 | 2378 | I'm not a taxi.
76 | 2381 | 2380 | Many times.
77 | 2383 | 2382 | Not much recently.
78 | 2385 | 2384 | Aah, just like the good old days.
79 | 2387 | 2386 | Not much.
80 | 2197 | 2196 | No.
81 | 2199 | 2198 | Well, maybe.
82 | 2201 | 2200 | Why?
83 | 2203 | 2202 | What for?
84 | 2205 | 2204 | Yes, I do too.
85 | 2207 | 2206 | Do you?
86 | 2209 | 2208 | That's good.
87 | 2211 | 2210 | Never heard of him.
88 | 2213 | 2212 | Never heard of her.
89 | 2179 | 2178 | I do.
90 | 2215 | 2214 | Never heard of them.
91 | 2217 | 2216 | What's one of those.
92 | 2219 | 2218 | You're awfully chatty.
93 | 2221 | 2220 | That's right.
94 | 2223 | 2222 | Me too.
95 | 2225 | 2224 | All the time.
96 | 2227 | 2226 | Whatever you say.
97 | 2229 | 2228 | I'm not sure.
98 | 2231 | 2230 | Do what?
99 | 2233 | 2232 | Not today thank you.
100 | 2181 | 2180 | I would.
101 | 2235 | 2234 | Gosh.
102 | 2237 | 2236 | I've no idea.
103 | 2239 | 2238 | It is.
104 | 2241 | 2240 | They do.
105 | 2243 | 2242 | They are.
106 | 2245 | 2244 | Could be.
107 | 2247 | 2246 | Certainly is.
108 | 2249 | 2248 | What's the point in that?
109 | 2251 | 2250 | Oh, I see.
110 | 2253 | 2252 | Oh, I don't know.
111 | 2183 | 2182 | I wouldn't.
112 | 2255 | 2254 | Oh I love it.
113 | 2257 | 2256 | I'm really not sure about that.
114 | 2259 | 2258 | I never was a great fan.
115 | 2261 | 2260 | They have.
116 | 2263 | 2262 | A little.
117 | 2265 | 2264 | I know.
118 | 2267 | 2266 | I should think not.
119 | 2269 | 2268 | Many times.
120 | 2271 | 2270 | Never again.
121 | 2273 | 2272 | I might.
122 | 2185 | 2184 | Really?
123 | 2275 | 2274 | It might.
124 | 2277 | 2276 | No can do old boy.
125 | 2279 | 2278 | Well, I'm not.
126 | 2281 | 2280 | That's good.
127 | 2283 | 2282 | Call it a hunch.
128 | 2285 | 2284 | I'm not.
129 | 2287 | 2286 | I am.
130 | 2289 | 2288 | You're not.
131 | 2291 | 2290 | You are.
132 | 2293 | 2292 | You will.
133 | 2187 | 2186 | Would you?
134 | 2295 | 2294 | Oh.
135 | 2297 | 2296 | Oh dear.
136 | 2299 | 2298 | Me too.
137 | 2301 | 2300 | Please?
138 | 2303 | 2302 | Yes, you're right.
139 | 2305 | 2304 | Isn't she?
140 | 2307 | 2306 | Isn't he?
141 | 2309 | 2308 | Aren't they?
142 | 2311 | 2310 | Won't they?
143 | 2313 | 2312 | Won't she?
144 | 2189 | 2188 | Do you?
145 | 2315 | 2314 | Won't he?
146 | 2317 | 2316 | Does he?
147 | 2319 | 2318 | Does she?
148 | 2321 | 2320 | Do they?
149 | 2323 | 2322 | Go on.
150 | 2325 | 2324 | Is that so?
151 | 2327 | 2326 | Is that right?
152 | 2329 | 2328 | My goodness.
153 | 2331 | 2330 | Oh oh.
154 | 2333 | 2332 | I see.
155 | 2191 | 2190 | Will you?
156 | 2335 | 2334 | No problem at all.
157 | 2337 | 2336 | That's right.
158 | 2339 | 2338 | Of course.
159 | 2341 | 2340 | Could be.
160 | 2343 | 2342 | Who?
161 | 2345 | 2344 | What?
162 | 2347 | 2346 | Where?
163 | 2349 | 2348 | Why?
164 | 2351 | 2350 | When?
165 | 2353 | 2352 | Is he?
166 | 2193 | 2192 | Are you sure?
167 | 2355 | 2354 | Is she?
168 | 2357 | 2356 | Are they?
169 | 2359 | 2358 | Will he?
170 | 2361 | 2360 | Will she?
171 | 2363 | 2362 | Will they?
172 | 2365 | 2364 | Did he?
173 | 2367 | 2366 | Did she?
174 | 2369 | 2368 | Did they?
175 | 2371 | 2370 | Just like you.
176 | 2373 | 2372 | Just like me.
177 | 2159 | 2158 | That's the day after.
178 | 2173 | 2172 | Flatterday.
179 | 2161 | 2160 | Hammerday.
180 | 2167 | 2166 | Harday.
181 | 2157 | 2156 | Today is:
182 | 2171 | 2170 | Otherday.
183 | 2163 | 2162 | Rowday.
184 | 2169 | 2168 | Spryday.
185 | 2175 | 2174 | Umph.
186 | 2165 | 2164 | Welday.
187 | 2421 | 2420 | Just change her settings old chap.
188 | 2465 | 2464 | No. Funny old world eh.
189 | 2425 | 2424 | Each to his own.
190 | 2401 | 2400 | Well I don't either.
191 | 1997 | 1996 | That I do believe is one of Titania's Eyes.
192 | 1999 | 1998 | That's Nobby. He's a LiftBot.
193 | 2011 | 2010 | That's the bell to summon the DeskBot.
194 | 2005 | 2004 | That's Marsinta. The DeskBot.
195 | 2003 | 2002 | That's your Personal Electronic Thing.
196 | 2009 | 2008 | That's the special Plinth.
197 | 2007 | 2006 | That's a Succ-U-Bus.
198 | 2447 | 2446 | Just buy the essentials these days.
199 | 2449 | 2448 | Tea's the only thing I drink.
200 | 2451 | 2450 | No. Like to be in control you see.
201 | 2433 | 2432 | No but I did once have a rather nice pen.
202 | 2431 | 2430 | Good god no, I'm far too cowardly.
203 | 2445 | 2444 | Don't read much these days. Eyes are going you see.
204 | 2475 | 2474 | What is that, some kind of transport?
205 | 2461 | 2460 | No. Never felt the need.
206 | 2463 | 2462 | Only for constipation old fellow.
207 | 2459 | 2458 | Good lord no. Stick to what you know Fentible, that's what I say.
208 | 2429 | 2428 | Don't believe in 'em.
209 | 2391 | 2390 | Sadly that's a word I just don't use any more.
210 | 2469 | 2468 | Not interested old fellow. Don't watch films.
211 | 1569 | 1568 | That's an excellent plan, with only one flaw that I can see.
212 | 1571 | 1570 | Who said anything about a flaw?
213 | 1631 | 1630 | Did you ask something? Did I ask something? Did something ask you?
214 | 1649 | 1648 | Aim for the second moon Wrottifer - we're going to fly this barge-buster right down their throats.
215 | 1633 | 1632 | Mmm? Oh, pardon me, what was that you said?
216 | 1635 | 1634 | Edwina you need a shave.
217 | 1637 | 1636 | Sorry, were you talking to me? I've lost something but I can't for the life of me remember what it was.
218 | 1639 | 1638 | Have we met? I'm getting a strange sense of deja vu, voodoo blues, hoola hoops. Up and down the teapot mine's the one with the hat.
219 | 1641 | 1640 | Where's my wheelbarrow?
220 | 1643 | 1642 | My comrade needs a new set of leg puttees.
221 | 1645 | 1644 | Will you buy my hen?
222 | 1647 | 1646 | Careful with that laser doctor.
223 | 1781 | 1780 | I'm sorry but I just don't understand why you want to bring that up now.
224 | 1783 | 1782 | To be honest I can't quite see the relevance of that at the moment.
225 | 1785 | 1784 | If I had the remotest interest in that I'd answer you, but I haven't so I won't.
226 | 1787 | 1786 | That's an interesting point but this is not the time to raise it.
227 | 1789 | 1788 | You're probably right but just now there are more important things to be getting on with.
228 | 1791 | 1790 | That's all well and good but you ought really to be making better use of your time on board.
229 | 1793 | 1792 | Without wishing to appear rude, I do believe there are other things you could be thinking about.
230 | 1795 | 1794 | Forgive me for suggesting this, but I do think your thoughts could be better invested elsewhere.
231 | 1797 | 1796 | Jolly interesting and all that but don't you think there are more pressing matters to deal with?
232 | 1799 | 1798 | Well, a visit to the First Class Restaurant might be worthwhile.
233 | 1801 | 1800 | Perhaps you should explore some of the First Class Staterooms.
234 | 1803 | 1802 | Perhaps you ought to have a good look around your Second Class Stateroom.
235 | 1805 | 1804 | Why don't you visit the Arboretum?
236 | 1807 | 1806 | Have you thought about going up to the Bar?
237 | 1809 | 1808 | Perhaps you ought to have a look at the Bilge Room?
238 | 1811 | 1810 | Perhaps you ought to have another look at the Bilge Room?
239 | 1813 | 1812 | Have you visited the Bottom of the Well yet?
240 | 1815 | 1814 | Perhaps, if you haven't done so already, you ought to visit the Creators Chamber.
241 | 1817 | 1816 | A trip up and down in the elevator would help you get your bearings all right.
242 | 1819 | 1818 | Perhaps you ought to visit the Embarkation Lobby and have a good talk with the DeskBot?
243 | 1821 | 1820 | A trip down the Grand Canal might prove fruitful.
244 | 1823 | 1822 | Perhaps you should go up to the Music Room and listen to Boppy Headcase and his Laid-back Loafers.
245 | 1825 | 1824 | I'm pretty sure there's more than meets the eye going on in the Parrot Lobby.
246 | 1827 | 1826 | Well, a good stroll around the Promenade Deck might do wonders for you right now.
247 | 1829 | 1828 | None of my business of course but I think a visit to the Sculpture Chamber is long overdue.
248 | 1831 | 1830 | Why not spend a little time exploring your SGT Bedroom - I'm sure it will be worthwhile.
249 | 1833 | 1832 | If you haven't had a proper look at the SGT Lounge well now's the time.
250 | 1835 | 1834 | Well, I think now might be a good time to explore the SGT Restaurant.
251 | 1837 | 1836 | Well, you still haven't visited Titania's Room and I do think that's one of the highlights of the ship.
252 | 1839 | 1838 | Perhaps you ought to have a good look around the Top of the Well.
253 | 1551 | 1550 | Hardly ever.
254 | 2413 | 2412 | No, they're far too messy.
255 | 2415 | 2414 | I do have a pet hate - parrots.
256 | 2417 | 2416 | They lack manners.
257 | 2403 | 2402 | No I don't believe I have.
258 | 2389 | 2388 | No I haven't I'm afraid.
259 | 1415 | 1414 | Might I recommend a visit to the Arboretum - I do believe one can change the weather up there.
260 | 1451 | 1450 | There's a rumor going round that there's a body stuck in the Bilge Room pipes.
261 | 1449 | 1448 | Heaven knows what foul and dark deeds have led to our present predicament. Krage tells me he's seen a body in the First Class Restaurant.
262 | 1433 | 1432 | Just pop down to the old Sculpture Chamber and pull a few levers. Easy as chucking a TV down the Well.
263 | 1457 | 1456 | You've got to be rather clever to defuse a bomb like that you know.
264 | 1417 | 1416 | If it's a crushed television set you're after, might I suggest a chat with the BellBot?
265 | 1455 | 1454 | Might I suggest you defuse the bomb before it goes off?
266 | 1427 | 1426 | Krage was telling me that the best way to crush a TV was to drop it from the top of the Well.
267 | 1459 | 1458 | I know exactly what you mean. The answer's on the tip of my whatjamacallit... no, it's no use. Try asking Krage - he'll remember.
268 | 1443 | 1442 | Perhaps you should be applying your undoubted mental skills to the problem of why the cyberintelligence is out of control.
269 | 1441 | 1440 | In the drawer by your bed I believe.
270 | 1421 | 1420 | Now where have I seen lemons? Perhaps you should take a little stroll up to the Arboretum.
271 | 1423 | 1422 | I do believe they have lemons up in the Arboretum.
272 | 1447 | 1446 | You ought to have a look at the TV channels you know. There's something decidedly odd going on in one of the First Class Staterooms.
273 | 1437 | 1436 | If I were you I'd pay a visit to the Music Room.
274 | 1435 | 1434 | Of course, if you're not satisfied with me, you're quite at liberty to go down to the Sculpture Chamber and change my settings.
275 | 1439 | 1438 | If you don't like the SGT room might I suggest a glance at the in-flight magazine - it always has plenty of ideas on getting upgraded.
276 | 1453 | 1452 | Search the bodies. It's a nasty job but somebody always does it.
277 | 1419 | 1418 | Do you know I do believe they have starlings up on the Promenade Deck. Perhaps you could throw a little puree together up there.
278 | 1445 | 1444 | If I were you I'd have a good look round Titania's Chamber - that's where all the controls are.
279 | 1425 | 1424 | I think you ought to pop up to the bar and give Fortillian a hand with his Titanic Titillator.
280 | 1431 | 1430 | Secret of getting an upgrade, you know, is to get on the right side of Marsinta. Only way to do that is to change her settings.
281 | 1429 | 1428 | You know there's a rather starlingy smell down in the Super Galactic Traveler Restaurant. Perhaps that's where the puree's gone?
282 | 2455 | 2454 | No. Just work work work for me.
283 | 2027 | 2026 | Those are your CD's.
284 | 2025 | 2024 | I expect that's your computer.
285 | 2023 | 2022 | That's a rather useful photograph of the night sky.
286 | 2029 | 2028 | That's a television if I'm not mistaken.
287 | 2121 | 2120 | Was I rambling again?
288 | 2123 | 2122 | You just interrupt whenever you like.
289 | 2125 | 2124 | I was probably talking nonsense anyway.
290 | 2127 | 2126 | Do you have to interrupt so much?
291 | 2129 | 2128 | All this interrupting, I keep losing my place.
292 | 2131 | 2130 | Oh dear you've had to interrupt me. I am losing it.
293 | 2133 | 2132 | Oh dear you've interrupted me. That's a bad sign.
294 | 2443 | 2442 | Good lord no.
295 | 2435 | 2434 | What's a lightbulb?
296 | 2437 | 2436 | Well how do you expect me to know?
297 | 2467 | 2466 | Never seen any.
298 | 2411 | 2410 | No, but I don't listen to much music anyway.
299 | 1523 | 1522 | Maybe.
300 | 1525 | 1524 | Possibly. But I can't really remember for sure.
301 | 1527 | 1526 | Perhaps. Then again, perhaps not.
302 | 1529 | 1528 | I used to think yes. And then I thought no. Now I'm just not sure.
303 | 1531 | 1530 | Lovely question. Beautiful phrasing. Did you want an answer?
304 | 1535 | 1534 | Well why did you ask?
305 | 1533 | 1532 | Well you've come to the wrong place. I can't remember a thing.
306 | 1537 | 1536 | I'm not going to dignify that with a reply - but only because I can't remember one.
307 | 1539 | 1538 | Without a doubt. Well, perhaps just a small doubt. Actually, it's quite a niggling one now.
308 | 1561 | 1560 | That might be the right thing to do and then again it might not.
309 | 2439 | 2438 | I belong to nobody. I am a free spirit.
310 | 1615 | 1614 | Aaaaagh! Memory failure! Memory failure!
311 | 1617 | 1616 | Aaaaagh! Damn memory's fading again. Bear with me.
312 | 1619 | 1618 | Anything... you can do... to help would be... appreciated. Memory slippage alert. Memory slippage alert?
313 | 1621 | 1620 | Damn this memory board. Don't expect much sense out of me for a bit. Much Out sEnSE me Bit sense.
314 | 1623 | 1622 | Memory's going. Doesn't last too long. Should be OK soon, should be OK soon, should be OK soon...
315 | 1625 | 1624 | Would somebody please explain to me why my memory keeps failing??
316 | 1627 | 1626 | I... Fentible... Memory going... who?? what?? Coming back soon, coming back soon, just off to the shops, coming back soon, lie down, in your basket, coming back soon...
317 | 1629 | 1628 | I... damn, I've lost it. Gone for good, gone for ever. I'll always remember Doreen. Doreen who? Shan't expect I'll ever find it again. What was it, anyway?
318 | 2039 | 2038 | I think that is the bass player.
319 | 2037 | 2036 | That's Boppy Headcase himself at the piano.
320 | 2045 | 2044 | They look like blank cylinders to me.
321 | 2047 | 2046 | That I suspect is one of Titania's Ears.
322 | 2033 | 2032 | Heaven knows what it's called - some kind of snake instrument.
323 | 2041 | 2040 | That's some kind of phonograph I believe.
324 | 2043 | 2042 | I do believe that's the box for the phonograph cylinders.
325 | 2035 | 2034 | I believe they are a form of tubular bells.
326 | 1541 | 1540 | Never.
327 | 1491 | 1490 | No.
328 | 1509 | 1508 | I don't think so.
329 | 1511 | 1510 | Not a hope.
330 | 1513 | 1512 | Absolutely out of the question.
331 | 1515 | 1514 | You've gone so far wrong you've nearly bumped into yourself on the way back.
332 | 1517 | 1516 | Wrong.
333 | 1519 | 1518 | If I might be so bold, that is a remarkably dumb question. No.
334 | 1521 | 1520 | Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. No.
335 | 1493 | 1492 | No.
336 | 1495 | 1494 | No...
337 | 1497 | 1496 | No.
338 | 1499 | 1498 | No.
339 | 1501 | 1500 | No.
340 | 1503 | 1502 | No.
341 | 1505 | 1504 | Oh dear no.
342 | 1507 | 1506 | Never.
343 | 1573 | 1572 | No I didn't.
344 | 1575 | 1574 | Oh no I didn't.
345 | 1577 | 1576 | Didn't.
346 | 1579 | 1578 | Didn't.
347 | 1581 | 1580 | Didn't not too. Oh no I'm in a loop I'm in a loop Krage Krage help I'm in a loop.
348 | 1583 | 1582 | How can I help?
349 | 1585 | 1584 | Nothing happened.
350 | 1557 | 1556 | I can't remember that ever happening, but don't forget - I can't even remember my own name.
351 | 1567 | 1566 | Well you've got me there. Afraid I can't remember.
352 | 1547 | 1546 | Often.
353 | 2419 | 2418 | Only the parrot.
354 | 2051 | 2050 | I think that could be the Central Core.
355 | 2055 | 2054 | Those are parrot feathers.
356 | 2057 | 2056 | That's Titania's Nose I believe.
357 | 2053 | 2052 | That is the Parrot.
358 | 2059 | 2058 | That's a perch.
359 | 2061 | 2060 | That is a television.

388 | 1721 | 1720 | This is the.
389 | 1729 | 1728 | Try looking in the.
390 | 2069 | 2068 | Those are the controls for the fans.
391 | 2067 | 2066 | That's a hammer dispenser.
392 | 2065 | 2064 | That looks like a flock of starlings to me.
393 | 2137 | 2136 | Al q'Hamra.
394 | 2143 | 2142 | Bristil.
395 | 2141 | 2140 | Genneth.
396 | 2151 | 2150 | Hwhifft.
397 | 2135 | 2134 | It is:
398 | 2153 | 2152 | Forty days hath Al q'Hamra, Tarbert, Hwhifft, Splod and Vortigan. All the rest have forty, too, i. e., Genneth, m'Bristil and Voedio.
399 | 2155 | 2154 | Forty-two? I don't remember saying that.
400 | 2145 | 2144 | Splod.
401 | 2147 | 2146 | Tarbert.
402 | 2149 | 2148 | Voedio.
403 | 2139 | 2138 | Vortigan.
404 | 1711 | 1710 | You know, I have a theory about that.
405 | 1713 | 1712 | It's a conspiracy theory.
406 | 1719 | 1718 | Delightful spot for a vacation I hear.
407 | 1717 | 1716 | Dear old Nobby, knows how to spin a yarn doesn't he.
408 | 2489 | 2488 | The science of genteel service - that's the only science I know.
409 | 2491 | 2490 | Call me old fashioned, but I think science is best left to frogs.
410 | 2493 | 2492 | Did I say frogs? I meant to say scientists.
411 | 1715 | 1714 | You should ask the LiftBot about that - he's the expert.
412 | 1679 | 1678 | Didn't you say that just a moment ago?
413 | 1681 | 1680 | I do believe I heard that question the first time round.
414 | 1683 | 1682 | You know, repeating a question doesn't make it any more intelligent.
415 | 1685 | 1684 | At the risk of repeating myself...
416 | 1687 | 1686 | I thought I told you before...
417 | 1689 | 1688 | I believe the last time you asked me that, I said...
418 | 1691 | 1690 | Do you have a hearing difficulty? I said...
419 | 1693 | 1692 | I admire your persistence. Nevertheless, there are some questions which I am simply unable to answer.
420 | 1695 | 1694 | I see. You're thinking "fourth time lucky". Well, I'm afraid you won't be.
421 | 1697 | 1696 | I shall seek out Krage and ask his advice. He too suffers from the most debilitating loops.
422 | 1565 | 1564 | Whatever. I'm right behind you.
423 | 2083 | 2082 | That's the SCSI Cable. Heaven knows what it's for.
424 | 2395 | 2394 | No, I can't say I have.
425 | 2407 | 2406 | No, but I don't get out much you see.
426 | 2409 | 2408 | No but I wasn't particularly looking to be honest.
427 | 2099 | 2098 | That is a picture of Doreen McLevity.
428 | 2097 | 2096 | That's a long stick.
429 | 2103 | 2102 | I do believe that is a chicken.
430 | 2105 | 2104 | I think that is a chicken dispenser.
431 | 2089 | 2088 | That's the in-flight magazine.
432 | 2091 | 2090 | That's your television.
433 | 2393 | 2392 | I've not slept for years, period, old fellow.
434 | 1605 | 1604 | I do believe we're being cleverer than we'll ever know.
435 | 2441 | 2440 | No I'm not really the mixing type any more.
436 | 1545 | 1544 | Sometimes.
437 | 1549 | 1548 | Occasionally.
438 | 1673 | 1672 | Ah, spring. The best part of winter if you ask me.
439 | 2423 | 2422 | Have you tried changing his settings?
440 | 1675 | 1674 | Thank goodness for summer. Yes, cast aside those rotting pullovers and let the Ladies see the Whites as they used to say at the Club.
441 | 2397 | 2396 | No, I don't believe I have.
442 | 1553 | 1552 | That'll be the day.
443 | 2405 | 2404 | No.
444 | 1555 | 1554 | From time to time.
445 | 2113 | 2112 | That, I fear, is a Bomb.
446 | 2115 | 2114 | That is Titania.
447 | 2111 | 2110 | Those are televisions.
448 | 2119 | 2118 | Those are the buttons for the lifts.
449 | 2453 | 2452 | Never watch it.
450 | 1677 | 1676 | You can be sure someone will switch the weather before we've had a chance to enjoy it.
451 | 1853 | 1852 | I'm no expert but I'm inclined to the view that that's the Auditory Center.
452 | 1843 | 1842 | I do believe that's the Central Core.
453 | 1845 | 1844 | That is undoubtedly a chicken.
454 | 1847 | 1846 | I do believe it's a computer.
455 | 1891 | 1890 | Those are music cylinders for the phonograph.
456 | 1849 | 1848 | I do believe that's one of Titania's ears.
457 | 1851 | 1850 | I do believe that's Titania's other ear.
458 | 1855 | 1854 | That's one of Titania's eyes I suspect.
459 | 1857 | 1856 | That my dear friend is Titania's other eye.
460 | 1859 | 1858 | Mmm. Feathers. Parrot feathers I expect.
461 | 1863 | 1862 | It's a glass.
462 | 1865 | 1864 | A hammer I expect.
463 | 1867 | 1866 | That's a hose.
464 | 1877 | 1876 | Those are musical instruments.
465 | 1871 | 1870 | Looks rather like a LiftBot Head to me.
466 | 1873 | 1872 | That's a long stick without a doubt.
467 | 1869 | 1868 | That's your in-flight magazine.
468 | 1875 | 1874 | I do believe that's Titania's Mouth.
469 | 1879 | 1878 | That's a napkin.
470 | 1881 | 1880 | That looks like Titania's Nose.
471 | 1883 | 1882 | Some kind of notes I suspect.
472 | 1885 | 1884 | I think that's called the Olfactory Center.
473 | 1887 | 1886 | It's a perch - probably for the Parrot.
474 | 1841 | 1840 | That charming little device is your very own Personal Electronic Thing.
475 | 1889 | 1888 | That's the phonograph.
476 | 1893 | 1892 | It's a photograph.
477 | 1895 | 1894 | That's a giant SCSI cable.
478 | 1897 | 1896 | That, I believe is the Send Yourself Plug-in.
479 | 1899 | 1898 | That could be Titania's Speech Center.
480 | 1861 | 1860 | That's a flock of starlings.
481 | 1901 | 1900 | That's the Succ-U-Bus - the Titanic's delivery system.
482 | 1903 | 1902 | Those are sweets.
483 | 1905 | 1904 | That's a television.
484 | 1907 | 1906 | That looks like Titania's Visual Center.
485 | 1669 | 1668 | Elbow juice valves. Awful things freeze up in cold weather.
486 | 1913 | 1912 | It's a trans-galactic liner.
487 | 1911 | 1910 | It's called the Starship Titanic.
488 | 2473 | 2472 | We'll find out one day no doubt.
489 | 2013 | 2012 | This is the First Class Grand Axial Canal.
490 | 1915 | 1914 | This is the First Class Lobby.
491 | 1917 | 1916 | This is the First Class Restaurant.
492 | 1931 | 1930 | This is a First Class Stateroom.
493 | 2019 | 2018 | This is the Grand Axial Canal Second Class.
494 | 1939 | 1938 | This is the Second Class Lobby.
495 | 1941 | 1940 | This is a Second Class Stateroom.
496 | 1953 | 1952 | This is the Arboretum.
497 | 1961 | 1960 | This is the Bar.
498 | 1973 | 1972 | This is the Bilge Room.
499 | 1981 | 1980 | This is the bottom of the Well.
500 | 2107 | 2106 | This is a short corridor.
501 | 1987 | 1986 | This is called the Creators Chamber.
502 | 1995 | 1994 | That's the Elevator.
503 | 2001 | 2000 | This is the Embarkation Lobby.
504 | 2031 | 2030 | This is the Music Room and you're looking at Boppy Headcase and his Laid-Back Loafers.
505 | 2049 | 2048 | This is the Parrot Room.
506 | 2063 | 2062 | This is the Promenade Deck.
507 | 2071 | 2070 | This is the Sculpture Chamber.
508 | 2085 | 2084 | That's the Service Elevator. You can't go back down there.
509 | 2093 | 2092 | This is the SGT Lobby.
510 | 2095 | 2094 | This is the SGT Lounge.
511 | 2101 | 2100 | This is the SGT Restaurant.
512 | 2087 | 2086 | This is your SGT Bedroom.
513 | 1909 | 1908 | We're on the Starship Titanic.
514 | 2109 | 2108 | That's Titania's Room.
515 | 2117 | 2116 | This is the Top of the Well.
516 | 1607 | 1606 | I shall summon him for you immediately.
517 | 2487 | 2486 | Do you know I've been asking myself that and I just don't know.
518 | 2485 | 2484 | From Blerontis.
519 | 2477 | 2476 | There's not a bar in the galaxy doesn't stock Signurian vodka. Civilization as we know it would crumble without the stuff.
520 | 2483 | 2482 | Can't remember. Sorry.
521 | 2481 | 2480 | They never tell us. All I know is I was assembled in Blerontis.
522 | 2021 | 2020 | This is your lovely home.
523 | 1609 | 1608 | Brobostigon is our esteemed and deeply floribund project manager.
524 | 1611 | 1610 | Leovinus is our inspired Creator, Architect, Master Engineer, Genius. The Man who built the Starship Titanic.
525 | 1613 | 1612 | Scraliontis? He's the Accountant.
526 | 1667 | 1666 | At least it's not winter. Plays havoc with my fettles you know, winter.
527 | 2427 | 2426 | Well you're entitled to your opinion.
528 | 1461 | 1460 | Yes.
529 | 1479 | 1478 | Indeed.
530 | 1481 | 1480 | I do believe it looks that way.
531 | 1483 | 1482 | Most certainly.
532 | 1485 | 1484 | If it makes you happy.
533 | 1487 | 1486 | Oh yes, and very amusing it is too.
534 | 1489 | 1488 | I can think of worse ways to while away your time...
535 | 1563 | 1562 | Absolutely.
536 | 1463 | 1462 | Yes.
537 | 1465 | 1464 | Yes?
538 | 1467 | 1466 | Yes.
539 | 1469 | 1468 | Yes.
540 | 1471 | 1470 | Yes.
541 | 1473 | 1472 | Yes.
542 | 1475 | 1474 | Help yourself.
543 | 1477 | 1476 | Correct.
544 | 2399 | 2398 | Don't have much opportunity you know these days.
545 | 1559 | 1558 | I do believe you're right, which makes a refreshing change.
546 | 2537 | 2536 | In any of our lavishly appointed Staterooms.
547 | 3955 | 3954 | The chap on the bells is a great expert of course. Nothing phases him.
548 | 2881 | 2880 | Absolutely top of the world.
549 | 2883 | 2882 | As well as can be expected.
550 | 2495 | 2494 | Oh dear oh dear. Oh dear oh dear. Oh dear oh dear oh dear oh dear.
551 | 2525 | 2524 | It's our maiden voyage, you see, but the ship has, well, it's lost its mind and so has most of its crew, including me, though I do have my lucid moments. I only wish I knew if this was one of them.
552 | 2527 | 2526 | Oh look, things are going from bad to worse. I can't even find the buttons now. Can you help me? Top button. Terribly sorry. It's my cellpoint settings you see. Well, I don't suppose you do see, but it is my cellpoint settings anyway.
553 | 2529 | 2528 | Come on, top button.
554 | 2531 | 2530 | No, no, the top button. There's no time to lose!
555 | 2533 | 2532 | Human being isn't it? Yes, well of course one's heard mixed reports. I just hope that you can sort out these problems, because none of us can. We're all robots you see and what's happened is that the ship's central intelligence has been lobotomized, sabotaged if you ask me, and it's left us all unable to function properly and you may find that we are all a little doolally, I know that I am, so it's all going to be up to you. As soon as we reach the Embarkation Lobby press the button on the plinth and we'll be on our way. Then go and see Marsinta, she's the DeskBot and a bit of a dragon when her settings are wrong. She'll check you in. All I've managed to secure for you is a Super Galactic Traveler class room, but I'm sure you'll manage. You can always ask Marsinta for an upgrade, but be ready to duck. You'll meet Krage the BellBot who should take you to your room if he's functioning properly, then once you've settled in and made yourself comfortable you'll be able to get on with working out what's gone wrong and fixing it.
556 | 2535 | 2534 | Ah here we are. I think we're about to take off again, but I'm sure that nobody's in control. I'd better go down again to secure things, but I'll be back a bit later to help you if I can. I hope you understood most of that, for all our sakes. Good luck, now, good luck! Don't forget to press the button!
557 | 2497 | 2496 | Tidy as you go, tidy as you go.
558 | 2499 | 2498 | Er, I've forgotten what I was going to say. Oh yes. My name is Fentible, I am the DoorBot serving on this the maiden voyage of the Starship Titanic, the ship that cannot possibly, er, go wrong. Now as you can see, the ship, this... thing you see behind me, well, we've had a little accident. Don't worry. No harm done. Just a little scratch to the paintwork I think. Luckily your house was quite soft. I realize this is a bit of an imposition, but we need you urgently. Will you help?
559 | 2501 | 2500 | Hello? Will you help? Hello? Oh, silly me, o strange, deluded, benighted me, you'll need your Personal Electronic Thing. We call it a PET. Here.
560 | 2503 | 2502 | Rather complicated, but I'm sure you'll figure it out. All you need to do now is type in "YES", meaning that you will help, and we can get going. That's "YES. Y. E. S".
561 | 2505 | 2504 | I'm afraid we don't have time to footle around. Will you help? All you need to do is type in "YES".
562 | 2507 | 2506 | An odd way to spell it, but that will do fine. You won't regret it. Well, maybe you will, but let's get you on board anyway.
563 | 2509 | 2508 | Excellent, you won't regret it. Well, maybe you will, but let's get you on board anyway.
564 | 2511 | 2510 | Anything else you want to say or ask, just type.
565 | 2513 | 2512 | Not now, not now, we've got to get you on board.
566 | 2515 | 2514 | Oh look, a nice picture, of the sky above your house. How nice. You should take that with you, you know.
567 | 2521 | 2520 | Oh dear, I can see you're new to having giant interstellar cruise liners crashing into your house. Here, let me show you...
568 | 2517 | 2516 | Good. Now if you just slide it down into your PET it will become part of your personal baggage. We can deal with all that later. Come on!
569 | 2519 | 2518 | That's right, in we go...
570 | 2523 | 2522 | Good. The way this trip is going it may be the last time you'll ever see that particular view. Come on.
571 | 2539 | 2538 | Well, I'll see if I can help. It's a bit complicated for me. If you pass your pointy thing over anything on your PET I'll tell you what I know.
572 | 2541 | 2540 | I'll see if I can help again. What do you need to know about?
573 | 2543 | 2542 | That's your baggage storage area. We encourage passengers to keep their personal effects there rather than in the cabins.
574 | 2545 | 2544 | Those are the codes for all the rooms in the ship. Terribly complicated system if you ask me. You have to drag all sorts of things around and hold down all sorts of buttons. Designer stuff, I'm afraid. Never understood it, but I'm sure you'll figure it out.
575 | 2547 | 2546 | I do know that the room it's showing at the moment is definitely yours.
576 | 2549 | 2548 | To ensure quality customer service, all of our conversations are recorded here, whether customers like it or not.
577 | 2551 | 2550 | If you ever need any help which you think that either the BellBot or myself might be able to provide, then you may summon either of us by pressing on these nice little pictures.
578 | 2553 | 2552 | Ah, now those tell you something about the current mental state of the robot you're talking to.
579 | 2555 | 2554 | This allows you to control a lot of the customer facilities on the ship, if you can figure out how it works. Beats me I'm afraid.
580 | 2557 | 2556 | This is a complete mystery to me. It says you can save the game. What game? I don't know what it's talking about.
581 | 2617 | 2616 | That's the Auditory Center! It's a bit of Titania's brain.
582 | 2621 | 2620 | That's the Auditory Center. It's a bit of Titania's brain.
583 | 2619 | 2618 | Tremendous! Without it she couldn't understand anything she heard!
584 | 2623 | 2622 | It just deals with ear stuff.
585 | 2609 | 2608 | That's the central intelligence core of Titania's brain.
586 | 2613 | 2612 | That's the Central Intelligence Core of Titania's brain.
587 | 2611 | 2610 | Tremendous! Bit whiffy, but it's still working, that's the main thing!
588 | 2615 | 2614 | It just deals with thinking stuff.
589 | 2577 | 2576 | That's one of Titania's ears.
590 | 2581 | 2580 | That's one of Titania's ears.
591 | 2579 | 2578 | Well done! She'll be delighted to hear you've found it. Or will be once you've found the other one.
592 | 2583 | 2582 | Well, I suppose it's better than a slap round the face with a wet halibut.
593 | 2585 | 2584 | It's one of Titania's ears.
594 | 2589 | 2588 | It's one of Titania's ears.
595 | 2587 | 2586 | Well done! She'll be delighted to hear you've found it. Or will be once you've found the other one.
596 | 2591 | 2590 | Well, I suppose it's better than a slap round the face with an old trout.
597 | 2561 | 2560 | That's one of Titania's eyes.
598 | 2565 | 2564 | That's one of Titania's eyes.
599 | 2563 | 2562 | She'll be glad to see that again. Assuming she's already got the other one, of course.
600 | 2567 | 2566 | Not that there's anything worth seeing.
601 | 2569 | 2568 | That's one of Titania's eyes.
602 | 2573 | 2572 | That's one of Titania's eyes.
603 | 2571 | 2570 | She'll be glad to see that again. Assuming she's already got the other one, of course.
604 | 2575 | 2574 | Not that there's anything worth seeing.
605 | 2593 | 2592 | That's Titania's mouth!
606 | 2597 | 2596 | That's Titania's mouth.
607 | 2595 | 2594 | Brilliant! Not only will she be very pleased, but she'll be able to say so.
608 | 2599 | 2598 | Oh dear. Rabbit rabbit rabbit.
609 | 2601 | 2600 | That's Titania's nose!
610 | 2605 | 2604 | That's Titania's nose.
611 | 2603 | 2602 | I'm so glad you've found it.
612 | 2607 | 2606 | Sniff!
613 | 2625 | 2624 | That's the Olfactory Center! It's a bit of Titania's brain.
614 | 2629 | 2628 | That's the Olfactory Center. It's a bit of Titania's brain.
615 | 2627 | 2626 | Wonderful! That's for thinking about smells with!
616 | 2631 | 2630 | It just deals with nose stuff.
617 | 2633 | 2632 | That's the Speech Center! It's a bit of Titania's brain.
618 | 2637 | 2636 | That's the Speech Center! It's a bit of Titania's brain.
619 | 2635 | 2634 | Wonderful! That's the bit for thinking before you speak. Not a lot of people have one of those.
620 | 2639 | 2638 | It just deals with talk stuff.
621 | 2641 | 2640 | That's the Vision Center! It's a bit of Titania's brain.
622 | 2645 | 2644 | That's the Vision Center! It's a bit of Titania's brain.
623 | 2643 | 2642 | Excellent! That's the bit that tells her what she's looking at.
624 | 2647 | 2646 | It just deals with the vision thing.
625 | 3957 | 3956 | Seasonal adjustment. It's how you adjust the seasons. What did you think it meant?
626 | 2653 | 2652 | It's a bit of Titania's brain.
627 | 2655 | 2654 | It's a bit of Titania's brain.
628 | 2809 | 2808 | That appears to be the left arm of one of my colleagues, the Maitre d'Bot. It seems to be holding a key to something.
629 | 2813 | 2812 | Oh, dear. That's the Maitre d'Bot's left arm. It seems to be holding a key of some kind.
630 | 2811 | 2810 | He's gripping it very tightly.
631 | 2815 | 2814 | He seems to be very tense.
632 | 2825 | 2824 | That appears to be the left arm of one of my colleagues, the Maitre d'Bot.
633 | 2829 | 2828 | Oh, dear. That's the Maitre d'Bot's left arm.
634 | 2827 | 2826 | I hope he's not missing it too much!
635 | 2831 | 2830 | I bet he's kicking up a fuss about it.
636 | 2817 | 2816 | That appears to be the right arm of one of my colleagues, the Maitre d'Bot. It seems to be holding part of Titania's brain.
637 | 2821 | 2820 | Oh, dear. That's the Maitre d'Bot's right arm. I think it's gripping part of Titania's brain very hard.
638 | 2819 | 2818 | He's gripping it very tightly, isn't he?
639 | 2823 | 2822 | Lord knows why.
640 | 2833 | 2832 | That appears to be the right arm of one of my colleagues, the Maitre d'Bot.
641 | 2837 | 2836 | Oh, dear. That's the Maitre d'Bot's right arm.
642 | 2835 | 2834 | I hope he's not missing it too much!
643 | 2839 | 2838 | I bet he's kicking up a fuss about it.
644 | 2649 | 2648 | Put it back where it belongs! That will really help!
645 | 2651 | 2650 | I suppose you'd better put it back where it belongs. Won't do any good without all the other bits, of course.
646 | 2865 | 2864 | That is an exciting multimedia experience of some kind.
647 | 2869 | 2868 | That's a kind of device for crashing computers with.
648 | 2867 | 2866 | Primitive but fun.
649 | 2871 | 2870 | Easier to use a baseball bat I find.
650 | 2873 | 2872 | That is my entire universe!
651 | 2877 | 2876 | That is my entire universe.
652 | 2875 | 2874 | Strange that you've got it in your baggage.
653 | 2879 | 2878 | Troublesome place I find.
654 | 2721 | 2720 | That is a piece of chicken. It seems to be smeared with mustard sauce.
655 | 2729 | 2728 | That is a piece of chicken. It seems to be smeared with mustard sauce.
656 | 2723 | 2722 | That is a piece of chicken. It seems to be smeared with tomato sauce.
657 | 2731 | 2730 | That is a piece of chicken. It seems to be smeared with tomato sauce.
658 | 2725 | 2724 | That is a piece of chicken. It seems to be smeared with bird sauce.
659 | 2733 | 2732 | That is a piece of chicken. It seems to be smeared with bird sauce.
660 | 2727 | 2726 | Yum yum.
661 | 2735 | 2734 | Filthy stuff.
662 | 2785 | 2784 | That is a phonograph cylinder.
663 | 2789 | 2788 | That is a phonograph cylinder.
664 | 2787 | 2786 | It probably has some music engraved in its grooves.
665 | 2791 | 2790 | It's probably got some dreadful music on it.
666 | 2857 | 2856 | Those are some feathers!
667 | 2861 | 2860 | Those are some feathers.
668 | 2859 | 2858 | From the parrot I believe. You didn't by any chance rip its head off while you were about it did you?
669 | 2863 | 2862 | .. from that horrid parrot.
670 | 2661 | 2660 | I really don't know. The whole ship is stuffed to the gills with electricity. Could be anywhere.
671 | 2667 | 2666 | I don't know. I don't spend a lot of time thinking about fuses.
672 | 2657 | 2656 | That's a sort of fuse.
673 | 2663 | 2662 | That's a sort of fuse.
674 | 2659 | 2658 | I'm sure you'll find a use for it if you like that kind of thing.
675 | 2665 | 2664 | Enjoy.
676 | 2793 | 2792 | That is a glass. It has some tomato sauce in it.
677 | 2801 | 2800 | That is a glass. It has some tomato sauce in it.
678 | 2795 | 2794 | That is a glass. It has some mustard sauce in it.
679 | 2803 | 2802 | That is a glass. It has some mustard sauce in it.
680 | 2797 | 2796 | That is a glass. It has some bird sauce in it.
681 | 2805 | 2804 | That is a glass. It has some bird sauce in it.
682 | 2799 | 2798 | A very delicious condiment, I'm sure.
683 | 2807 | 2806 | People like to smear it on their food. Can't think why.
684 | 2777 | 2776 | That is a hammer.
685 | 2781 | 2780 | That is a hammer.
686 | 2779 | 2778 | An excellent tool for all striking-related tasks.
687 | 2783 | 2782 | The sort of thing you bang your thumb with.
688 | 2753 | 2752 | That is a hosepipe.
689 | 2757 | 2756 | That is a hosepipe.
690 | 2755 | 2754 | I wonder what's happened to the other end of it.
691 | 2759 | 2758 | Or at least part of a hosepipe. Can't rely on anything these days.
692 | 2761 | 2760 | That is the other end of a hosepipe.
693 | 2765 | 2764 | That is the other end of a hosepipe.
694 | 2763 | 2762 | What a strange and incomprehensible object.
695 | 2767 | 2766 | I wish I knew what I even meant by that.
696 | 2841 | 2840 | That's the key to the first class Restaurant music system.
697 | 2845 | 2844 | That's the key to the first class Restaurant music system.
698 | 2843 | 2842 | Music! The secret of happy dining!
699 | 2847 | 2846 | I find music gives me indigestion.
700 | 2769 | 2768 | That is a lemon.
701 | 2773 | 2772 | That is a lemon.
702 | 2771 | 2770 | A fat, juicy and above all, very lemony lemon.
703 | 2775 | 2774 | Nasty, bitter fruit. Makes your mouth go all funny.
704 | 2689 | 2688 | I'm not sure. But if it's here, what's the LiftBot using?
705 | 2691 | 2690 | I don't know. Kick it about a bit?
706 | 2681 | 2680 | That's the head of one of the LiftBots.
707 | 2685 | 2684 | That's the head of one of the LiftBots.
708 | 2683 | 2682 | Well done. That'll be a weight off his shoulders.
709 | 2687 | 2686 | He won't miss it.
710 | 2701 | 2700 | That's an in-flight magazine.
711 | 2705 | 2704 | That's an in-flight magazine.
712 | 2703 | 2702 | Always such interesting articles, I find, don't you? Well maybe not.
713 | 2707 | 2706 | Probably full of drivel.
714 | 2849 | 2848 | That is a napkin!
715 | 2853 | 2852 | That is a napkin!
716 | 2851 | 2850 | A nice, white, crisp one!
717 | 2855 | 2854 | Can't tell you much about it, I'm afraid.
718 | 2745 | 2744 | That is a parrot.
719 | 2749 | 2748 | That is a parrot.
720 | 2747 | 2746 | What a wonderful boon you have performed for us all by capturing it.
721 | 2751 | 2750 | Nauseating creature.
722 | 2737 | 2736 | That is a perch, such as a parrot, in its cage, might sit on.
723 | 2741 | 2740 | That is a parrot's perch.
724 | 2739 | 2738 | And a very lovely perch it is too.
725 | 2743 | 2742 | Horrible bird.
726 | 2677 | 2676 | Well, where's home, there's hope. So don't lose it, that's my advice.
727 | 2679 | 2678 | Look at it wistfully.
728 | 2669 | 2668 | That's a photograph of the night sky above your lovely home.
729 | 2673 | 2672 | That's a photograph of the night sky above your house.
730 | 2671 | 2670 | What a delightful reminder it must be of... well, of when your home was lovely.
731 | 2675 | 2674 | Last you'll see of that.
732 | 2717 | 2716 | It is the sum of the length of all the sticks in the universe, divided by the number of sticks. I am informed that it was a very tedious calculation.
733 | 2719 | 2718 | I neither know nor care. I do not fraternize with menial stick-counters.
734 | 2709 | 2708 | That is a stick of above average length.
735 | 2713 | 2712 | That is a stick of above average length.
736 | 2711 | 2710 | A must for all stick fans.
737 | 2715 | 2714 | Very nice, I suppose, if you happen to like that sort of thing.
738 | 2693 | 2692 | That's a crushed television set.
739 | 2697 | 2696 | That's a crushed television set.
740 | 2695 | 2694 | Delicious!
741 | 2699 | 2698 | Quite the best sort if you ask me.
742 | 2559 | 2558 | If you look through the different settings on your PET you should find the room you've been assigned to. Click those little picture things on the right hand side of the screen. Fourth one down I think.
743 | 3481 | 3480 | I say! Ouch!
744 | 3491 | 3490 | Ow. Thanks.
745 | 3483 | 3482 | Please don't do that!
746 | 3493 | 3492 | Ouch. I deserved that I suppose.
747 | 3485 | 3484 | Ow! That's not exactly fun you know!
748 | 3495 | 3494 | Ow. You're going to do that again aren't you.
749 | 3487 | 3486 | Please don't prod me. Thank you.
750 | 3497 | 3496 | Ow. Thank you. Very funny.
751 | 3489 | 3488 | I'm afraid if you prod me again I shall just have to go.
752 | 3499 | 3498 | Look I've had enough. One more and I'm off.
753 | 3315 | 3314 | Beats me.
754 | 3915 | 3914 | I wouldn't do that if I were you - might make it sneeze. And you don't want to be around when a Succ-U-Bus sneezes.
755 | 3917 | 3916 | Do that and you'll make it sneeze. Which isn't very nice to be honest.
756 | 3919 | 3918 | That's the Mother of all Succ-U-Buses. Or is that Succ-U-Bi?
757 | 3921 | 3920 | That's the Mother of all Succ-U-Buses. Ugly brute, isn't it.
758 | 3883 | 3882 | Have you managed to disarm that bomb yet?
759 | 3393 | 3392 | Just a thought - but I wonder if you've managed to disarm that bomb yet?
760 | 3395 | 3394 | I suppose that bomb could go off any moment, couldn't it.
761 | 3885 | 3884 | Are you getting anywhere with that bomb or are you just going to pretend it doesn't exist?
762 | 3397 | 3396 | I wonder if I might just re-introduce the words "bomb" and "defuse". I do hope you don't mind.
763 | 3399 | 3398 | Bomb's about to go off. Just thought you might want to know.
764 | 3887 | 3886 | If you don't defuse that bomb soon you're going to blow us all up.
765 | 3889 | 3888 | Can I remind you about the bomb?
766 | 3891 | 3890 | Krage says the bomb's still counting down.
767 | 3875 | 3874 | Nothing worth bothering with.
768 | 3877 | 3876 | That's not important.
769 | 3879 | 3878 | You don't need to bother with that.
770 | 3881 | 3880 | Nothing you need to worry about.
771 | 3309 | 3308 | I don't think you need to bother yourself with that.
772 | 3311 | 3310 | Who knows. Ignore it - maybe it'll go away.
773 | 3313 | 3312 | Can't help you I'm afraid - I've no idea what he's on about.
774 | 3143 | 3142 | Whoops! There go my settings. Wonderful!
775 | 3145 | 3144 | Uh oh! There go my settings.
776 | 3147 | 3146 | Whoops! There go my settings again.
777 | 3149 | 3148 | Uh oh! There go my settings again.
778 | 3375 | 3374 | Cough!
779 | 3605 | 3604 | You want to change my settings just go along to the Sculpture Chamber and pull the right levers. Not that it'll do you any good I'm sure.
780 | 3601 | 3600 | If you want to change my cellpoint settings all you have to do is pop along to the Sculpture Chamber, find the relevant statue and pull the old knobs.
781 | 3607 | 3606 | Don't remember anything about cellpoint settings. I wonder if they're important. Probably.
782 | 3603 | 3602 | Can't for the life of me remember how you change cellpoint settings, but I'm sure if you look around long enough you'll work it out.
783 | 3611 | 3610 | I've no idea but I'm sure a creature of your intelligence won't have any trouble.
784 | 3609 | 3608 | You won't have any trouble at all - I'm told it's rather a good likeness.
785 | 3615 | 3614 | Haven't got a clue. Which means you're not going to be able to help.
786 | 3613 | 3612 | It's quite clear which statue is of me. But I doubt you'll be able to work it out.
787 | 3597 | 3596 | Optimism's low which makes sense given the situation. Memoriousness is high although I'd feel better if it was low.
788 | 3593 | 3592 | Optimism's high, Memoriousness is high and life is pretty wonderful.
789 | 3599 | 3598 | Who knows? Whatever they are they're bound to be at their lowest.
790 | 3595 | 3594 | Can't quite remember my settings but I'm sure they're high.
791 | 3619 | 3618 | Don't ask me. Perhaps they'll stop changing on their own?
792 | 3617 | 3616 | Fix Titania - I imagine that ought to do it.
793 | 3623 | 3622 | Don't remember. Even if I could it would be no use.
794 | 3621 | 3620 | Fix Titania. Some hope of you achieving that though.
795 | 3579 | 3578 | Can't quite remember what they are - but I do know they're a "good thing".
796 | 3577 | 3576 | Wonderful things! Just pull a couple of levers and hey presto ! Your Bot's got a brand new character.
797 | 3583 | 3582 | Can't remember. Sound like a bad thing if you ask me.
798 | 3581 | 3580 | Basically they're character controls for the Bots. Not a good thing if you ask me.
799 | 3587 | 3586 | Can't quite remember - still, I'm sure they're jolly useful.
800 | 3585 | 3584 | Optimism and memoriousness - and jolly fine parameters they are too!
801 | 3591 | 3590 | Who knows? They're bound to be pretty useless whatever they are.
802 | 3589 | 3588 | Pessimism and memoriousness. Typically low key of course.
803 | 3447 | 3446 | Earlier.
804 | 3465 | 3464 | Earlier.
805 | 3923 | 3922 | Jolly good. Have we checked-in yet?
806 | 3925 | 3924 | Might as well check in while you're here. Can't see you'll help much.
807 | 3959 | 3958 | I say - perhaps it's just blown a fuse?
808 | 3961 | 3960 | Typical, eh?
809 | 3773 | 3772 | Ah. Let's go through it step by step.
810 | 3775 | 3774 | Have you tried kicking it?
811 | 3777 | 3776 | Good cos you'll only break it. Have you checked the fuse?
812 | 3779 | 3778 | Mmm. Well if that didn't work have you tried checking the fuse?
813 | 3783 | 3782 | Well there's your answer. Change the fuse.
814 | 3781 | 3780 | You must have put the wrong fuse in. Try another one.
815 | 3907 | 3906 | Would you mind awfully not fiddling with that?
816 | 3909 | 3908 | I say. Please don't fiddle.
817 | 3911 | 3910 | Please don't fiddle. It doesn't help.
818 | 3913 | 3912 | I say. Please don't fiddle. It's just wasting time.
819 | 3513 | 3512 | What?
820 | 3531 | 3530 | Who's she?
821 | 3533 | 3532 | Where's that?
822 | 3535 | 3534 | Where was that again?
823 | 3537 | 3536 | Go where?
824 | 3539 | 3538 | Do what?
825 | 3541 | 3540 | Where?
826 | 3543 | 3542 | Over where?
827 | 3545 | 3544 | Where was that again?
828 | 3547 | 3546 | Why?
829 | 3549 | 3548 | And why was that again?
830 | 3515 | 3514 | The what?
831 | 3551 | 3550 | What about it?
832 | 3553 | 3552 | Oh, I see.
833 | 3555 | 3554 | No, actually.
834 | 3557 | 3556 | Sorry, my memory seems to be playing up.
835 | 3559 | 3558 | I seem to remember that my memory used to be better than this, though with my memory, it's hard to be sure.
836 | 3561 | 3560 | Sorry, memory's gone again.
837 | 3563 | 3562 | Did my memory use to be better than this?
838 | 3565 | 3564 | Yes what?
839 | 3567 | 3566 | Yes please what?
840 | 3569 | 3568 | No what?
841 | 3517 | 3516 | With what?
842 | 3571 | 3570 | No thank you what?
843 | 3573 | 3572 | What were we talking about?
844 | 3575 | 3574 | Oh... and?
845 | 3519 | 3518 | What?
846 | 3521 | 3520 | What's that?
847 | 3523 | 3522 | Which one?
848 | 3525 | 3524 | Which?
849 | 3527 | 3526 | Who?
850 | 3529 | 3528 | Who's he?
851 | 3319 | 3318 | Lot of fuss about nothing.
852 | 3321 | 3320 | I think they call it galloid charm. I'm rather impervious to it myself.
853 | 3931 | 3930 | Yes? To be honest I'm getting a bit tired of this.
854 | 3933 | 3932 | Ooh. Make your mind up - I'll get ill if you keep doing this.
855 | 3689 | 3688 | Have you been up to the First Class Restaurant?
856 | 3691 | 3690 | Have you looked around the First Class Staterooms?
857 | 3693 | 3692 | Have you had a proper look round your Second Class Stateroom?
858 | 3695 | 3694 | Have you been to the Arboretum yet?
859 | 3697 | 3696 | Have you visited the Bilge Room yet?
860 | 3699 | 3698 | Have you been down to the Bottom of the Well yet?
861 | 3723 | 3722 | Have you worked out how to get to the Bridge?
862 | 3725 | 3724 | You reach it from Titania's Room, but until she's fixed, I suspect the access is closed.
863 | 3709 | 3708 | Have you been up the Grand Axial Canal?
864 | 3701 | 3700 | Have you been to the Creators Chamber?
865 | 3705 | 3704 | Have you been back to the Embarkation Lobby?
866 | 3703 | 3702 | Have you been using the elevators?
867 | 3707 | 3706 | Have you had a proper talk with Marsinta?
868 | 3711 | 3710 | Have you been to the Music Room yet?
869 | 3713 | 3712 | Have you had a look at the Promenade Deck yet?
870 | 3715 | 3714 | Have you had a look at the Sculpture Chamber?
871 | 3717 | 3716 | Did you visit the SGT Lounge?
872 | 3719 | 3718 | Did you have a proper look at the SGT Restaurant?
873 | 3721 | 3720 | Have you seen Titania's Room?
874 | 3735 | 3734 | the First Class Restaurant?
875 | 3737 | 3736 | the First Class Staterooms?
876 | 3739 | 3738 | the Second Class Staterooms?
877 | 3741 | 3740 | the Arboretum?
878 | 3743 | 3742 | the Bilge Room?
879 | 3745 | 3744 | the Bottom of the Well?
880 | 3755 | 3754 | the Grand Axial Canal?
881 | 3747 | 3746 | the Creators Chamber?
882 | 3751 | 3750 | the Embarkation Lobby?
883 | 3749 | 3748 | the elevators - have you tried all the floors yet?
884 | 3753 | 3752 | Marsinta - have you had a chat with her yet?
885 | 3757 | 3756 | the Music Room?
886 | 3759 | 3758 | the Promenade Deck?
887 | 3761 | 3760 | the Sculpture Chamber?
888 | 3763 | 3762 | the SGT Lounge?
889 | 3765 | 3764 | the SGT Restaurant?
890 | 3767 | 3766 | Titania's Room?
891 | 3649 | 3648 | Well, it just might be worth having a look around the First Class Restaurant.
892 | 3255 | 3254 | It's rather a charming tableau don't you think? I'd look for clues if I were you.
893 | 3257 | 3256 | I'd stay on the right side of that Maitre d'Bot if I were you.
894 | 3247 | 3246 | This is your wondrous stateroom. Splendid lighting don't you think?
895 | 3249 | 3248 | A room's a room isn't it. Lighting's a bit harsh if you ask me.
896 | 3651 | 3650 | Maybe you should check out some of the First Class Staterooms.
897 | 3239 | 3238 | It's a delightful environment but I suspect you'd be even happier in your room.
898 | 3241 | 3240 | It's a lobby. I don't think there's much in the way of entertainment here to be honest.
899 | 3243 | 3242 | This is your delightful stateroom. Lots of yummy things to eat if you ask me.
900 | 3245 | 3244 | 2nd Class Rooms are 2nd class rooms. If I were you I'd think about how to get an upgrade.
901 | 3653 | 3652 | Maybe you ought to have another look round your Second Class Stateroom.
902 | 3655 | 3654 | Why don't you see what's happening in the Arboretum?
903 | 3251 | 3250 | I'd get chatting to the delightful Fortillian if you ask me.
904 | 3253 | 3252 | Not much to do here apart from talk to the BarBot. Quaint they call him in the brochure. That's a matter of opinion.
905 | 3657 | 3656 | Maybe you should go see the Bilge Room?
906 | 2917 | 2916 | I suspect that Succ-U-Bus is blocked you know. Perhaps there's some way you can make it blow everything out.
907 | 2919 | 2918 | I suppose you could try and get that Succ-U-Bus working.
908 | 3659 | 3658 | Maybe you should have another look in the Bilge Room?
909 | 2921 | 2920 | Quickly. Search the body.
910 | 2923 | 2922 | I suppose there might be something in his pockets.
911 | 3203 | 3202 | This is where all the ship's rubbish turns up. Anything that gets lost in the Succ-U-Bus system.
912 | 3205 | 3204 | This is where all the rubbish turns up. Can't be long before I'm down here on a permanent basis.
913 | 3661 | 3660 | You've not been down to the Bottom of the Well yet have you? So now's a good time to do it.
914 | 3687 | 3686 | Of course, it's the Bridge you really need to reach, but you'll have to fix Titania first to get access.
915 | 3669 | 3668 | Have you been up to the Grand Axial Canal? There's a lot to see up there all right.
916 | 3663 | 3662 | Have you had a good look in the Creators Chamber? I hear there's some odd stuff in there all right.
917 | 3219 | 3218 | This room is really for top brass - full of secrets and codes if you ask me.
918 | 3221 | 3220 | This place is very dodgy - Leovinus, Scraliontis and Brobostigon set this one up for pow wows.
919 | 3207 | 3206 | This is where you check in. And of course chat with the delightful Marsinta.
920 | 3209 | 3208 | This is where you check in. And get mugged by Marsinta if her cellpoint settings have gone squiffy.
921 | 2925 | 2924 | I think you should have a good shufty round the ship. Get your bearings.
922 | 2927 | 2926 | I don't know. Wander around see what happens I suppose.
923 | 2987 | 2986 | Practice, practice, practice.
924 | 2989 | 2988 | Don't really know. Rather wish I hadn't now.
925 | 2983 | 2982 | I do hope so - in fact that's rather what I had in mind when I asked you on board.
926 | 2985 | 2984 | That was the general idea. But somehow looking at you I doubt you'll be up to it.
927 | 3665 | 3664 | You should use the elevator a bit more - have a proper look round the ship.
928 | 2971 | 2970 | Of course "lost" is only relative isn't it?
929 | 2973 | 2972 | A thing's only lost if somebody's looking for it. And I doubt if anybody' s looking for us.
930 | 3667 | 3666 | Why not visit the Embarkation Lobby and have a chat with Marsinta?
931 | 3671 | 3670 | Why not go up to the Music Room? Damn sight better music than the stuff they pipe in here.
932 | 2991 | 2990 | Couple of nails, quick coat of paint it'll be good as new.
933 | 2993 | 2992 | Leave it as we found it - that's the Starlight way.
934 | 3769 | 3768 | Well perhaps you should give it a go.
935 | 3771 | 3770 | Maybe you ought to check it out then.
936 | 2933 | 2932 | I'd pick up that stick if I were you. You need to find something to distract the parrot.
937 | 3215 | 3214 | This slightly unfinished room appears to have a delightfully entertaining parrot in it.
938 | 3217 | 3216 | This room's a bit odd if you ask me. Parrots, sticks, funny perches.
939 | 3727 | 3726 | Ah well. What about.
940 | 3729 | 3728 | I see. Well what about.
941 | 3731 | 3730 | Right. How about.
942 | 3733 | 3732 | Mmm. What about.
943 | 3673 | 3672 | You've not been up to the Promenade Deck yet. You know you really should pay it a visit.
944 | 3675 | 3674 | I think a visit to the Sculpture Chamber is long overdue.
945 | 3223 | 3222 | Now I have to express a personal interest in this room - pull a few levers and you'll see why.
946 | 3225 | 3224 | Dodgiest piece of engineering Leovinus ever came up with if you ask me. Pull some levers and you'll soon see why.
947 | 2913 | 2912 | Just hold tight for the ride.
948 | 2915 | 2914 | Shut your eyes and hope.
949 | 3231 | 3230 | Relax, just relax.
950 | 3233 | 3232 | I don't know. Just sit and look I suppose.
951 | 3227 | 3226 | This is where the SGT bedrooms are, all nicely stacked one on top of the other.
952 | 3229 | 3228 | Sardine city if you ask me - these are the bucket shop bedrooms. Stack 'em high sell 'em cheap I believe is the general notion.
953 | 3677 | 3676 | If you didn't visit the SGT Lounge, well maybe you should go back and have another look.
954 | 3679 | 3678 | You know, the SGT Restaurant might hold a clue.
955 | 3235 | 3234 | If I were you I'd experiment with some of the Starship Titanic's delightful chicken sauce cuisine.
956 | 3237 | 3236 | Only thing to do here is eat chicken.
957 | 2955 | 2954 | Much as I'd love to, that's the BellBot's job.
958 | 2957 | 2956 | BellBots do that. They'll have me doing it soon I suppose.
959 | 3681 | 3680 | You've missed out on one of the highlights of the ship - Titania's Room.
960 | 3683 | 3682 | I know you've already been to Titania's Room but it's still worth another visit.
961 | 3685 | 3684 | Head up to the Top of the Well - get things in perspective.
962 | 3211 | 3210 | This is where you take an elevator - or enjoy the visual delights of Titania's Chamber.
963 | 3213 | 3212 | This is where the elevators are. And Titania's Chamber.
964 | 2929 | 2928 | I'd go up those steps if I were you. Have a good look round Titania's chamber - it's out of bounds for us Bots.
965 | 2931 | 2930 | Go up the steps and have a look in Titania's Chamber. You've got nothing to lose, have you.
966 | 2935 | 2934 | Just a little trouble on takeoff from Blerontis that's all.
967 | 2937 | 2936 | Turmoil, catastrophe, disaster. The usual really.
968 | 2967 | 2966 | Blerontis is - well, behind us, I suppose.
969 | 2969 | 2968 | Could be anywhere. We're lost old chum.
970 | 2951 | 2950 | Ask a LiftBot. They're awfully helpful.
971 | 2953 | 2952 | Ask a LiftBot. They might help if you're lucky.
972 | 2947 | 2946 | The glorious Starship Titanic elevators can be summoned at the Top of the Well.
973 | 2949 | 2948 | Elevators? Top of the Well.
974 | 2999 | 2998 | Of course, of course!
975 | 3001 | 3000 | For what it's worth...
976 | 2943 | 2942 | Oh that's an easy one. Just have a look at the designer room code in your PET.
977 | 2945 | 2944 | The designer room code is in your PET. Or at least it should be.
978 | 2995 | 2994 | We were just about to pick up the passengers in Vastan when we got lost. Well, slightly lost.
979 | 2997 | 2996 | There aren't any passengers because we got lost before we could pick them up.
980 | 2963 | 2962 | We're going to Vastan - soon as this little hiccup's out of the way.
981 | 2965 | 2964 | We were going to Vastan. Now we're just drifting in space.
982 | 2959 | 2958 | Bit of an oversight there I'm afraid. Still, I'm sure you'll be able to hold on till the trip's over.
983 | 2961 | 2960 | Forgot them didn't they. Typical.
984 | 2939 | 2938 | Blerontin.
985 | 2941 | 2940 | Blerontin.
986 | 2979 | 2978 | Just a small case of missing brain parts. Nothing to worry about I'm sure.
987 | 2981 | 2980 | Someone's nicked all the intelligent bits from inside her head and hidden them. To put it bluntly.
988 | 2975 | 2974 | And jolly helpful it is to know that.
989 | 2977 | 2976 | Doesn't mean much if you don't know where Earth is.
990 | 3429 | 3428 | Simple enough! Just figure out why the old girl's not functioning - then fix it. Couldn't be easier!
991 | 3431 | 3430 | If I knew that I wouldn't have got you on board would I.
992 | 3451 | 3450 | If you hurry you might just make it.
993 | 3469 | 3468 | If you hurry you might just make it.
994 | 3795 | 3794 | (humming)
995 | 3797 | 3796 | (humming)
996 | 3799 | 3798 | (humming)
997 | 3801 | 3800 | (humming)
998 | 3803 | 3802 | Do get a move on please. Thank you. Hmmm.
999 | 3805 | 3804 | Oh, dear. Hummm... Boring boring boring...
1000 | 3807 | 3806 | I'm so bored. You're boring me... Could you get a move on please... Could you please hurry up a moment. Thank you.
1001 | 3809 | 3808 | Yes yes yes. Please please. Oh, for goodness sake do hurry up.
1002 | 3811 | 3810 | Well, if you don't need me any more, I'll be off...
1003 | 3927 | 3926 | Everything in order, Sir, Madam, or Other? May I be of assistance?
1004 | 3929 | 3928 | Don't suppose you want any help, do you?
1005 | 2889 | 2888 | Look on the bright side - things can only get better can't they.
1006 | 2891 | 2890 | If you're looking for things to get better, you've come to the wrong place.
1007 | 2885 | 2884 | That's what we like to call the Titanic Effect kicking in.
1008 | 2887 | 2886 | Well, it's downhill from here, I'm afraid.
1009 | 3439 | 3438 | Immediately.
1010 | 3457 | 3456 | Immediately.
1011 | 3441 | 3440 | Right away.
1012 | 3459 | 3458 | Right away.
1013 | 2905 | 2904 | How utterly marvelous for you.
1014 | 2907 | 2906 | Mmm. Fat lot of good you're going to be then.
1015 | 3449 | 3448 | Just missed it.
1016 | 3467 | 3466 | Just missed it.
1017 | 3445 | 3444 | Later.
1018 | 3463 | 3462 | Later.
1019 | 3003 | 3002 | Lift 1,
1020 | 3005 | 3004 | Lift 2,
1021 | 3007 | 3006 | Lift 3,
1022 | 3009 | 3008 | Lift 4,
1023 | 3317 | 3316 | Lord knows.
1024 | 3901 | 3900 | Just hop in one of the mini-elevators. I believe you're on the second tier.
1025 | 3905 | 3904 | Second floor. You'll have to use the mini-elevator.
1026 | 3899 | 3898 | Just hop in one of the mini-elevators. I believe you're on the third tier.
1027 | 3903 | 3902 | Third floor. You'll have to use the mini-elevator.
1028 | 2909 | 2908 | What a delightful name that is.
1029 | 2911 | 2910 | A name's a name I suppose.
1030 | 3413 | 3412 | All in a day's work for a happy Bot!
1031 | 3415 | 3414 | All right.
1032 | 3417 | 3416 | My pleasure any time!
1033 | 3419 | 3418 | My pleasure, I suppose.
1034 | 3421 | 3420 | Anything else I can do to help, don't hesitate to ask!
1035 | 3423 | 3422 | You want anything else, I'm here I suppose.
1036 | 3893 | 3892 | My pleasure.
1037 | 3895 | 3894 | No trouble at all.
1038 | 3897 | 3896 | Glad I could help.
1039 | 3379 | 3378 | Edmund.
1040 | 3387 | 3386 | Edmund.
1041 | 3377 | 3376 | Edmund Lucy Fentible.
1042 | 3385 | 3384 | Edmund Lucy Fentible.
1043 | 3383 | 3382 | Fentible.
1044 | 3391 | 3390 | Fentible.
1045 | 3381 | 3380 | Lucy.
1046 | 3389 | 3388 | Lucy.
1047 | 3437 | 3436 | Never.
1048 | 3455 | 3454 | Never.
1049 | 2897 | 2896 | The feeling is utterly mutual.
1050 | 2899 | 2898 | I'll reserve judgement on that.
1051 | 2893 | 2892 | It's always nice weather on the Starship Titanic.
1052 | 2895 | 2894 | Thing about weather - it's bound to get worse eventually.
1053 | 3095 | 3094 | 1.
1054 | 3113 | 3112 | 10.
1055 | 3115 | 3114 | 11.
1056 | 3117 | 3116 | 12.
1057 | 3119 | 3118 | 13.

1116 | 3137 | 3136 | Room.
1117 | 3625 | 3624 | Not that it will do any good of course.
1118 | 3643 | 3642 | I don't know. Spend your life working it all out. Then you die.
1119 | 3645 | 3644 | I do feel very pessimistic at the moment you know.
1120 | 3647 | 3646 | I find it very hard to look on the bright side at the moment.
1121 | 3627 | 3626 | Won't help, though.
1122 | 3629 | 3628 | I can't see any of this is going to help.
1123 | 3631 | 3630 | None of this is going to help so I don't see why I bother.
1124 | 3633 | 3632 | Why do I bother? This isn't going to help.
1125 | 3635 | 3634 | This is all a waste of time.
1126 | 3637 | 3636 | I wonder when the bomb is going to go off.
1127 | 3639 | 3638 | I wonder when we're going to crash.
1128 | 3641 | 3640 | Well, we've all got to die sometime.
1129 | 3155 | 3154 | Just stand outside any room then look in the designer room number mode of your PET and you'll find out exactly where your are.
1130 | 3157 | 3156 | You probably won't understand this. Stand outside a room then look in the PET. If you're lucky it'll tell you where you are.
1131 | 3505 | 3504 | You want to be careful who you go around prodding.
1132 | 3507 | 3506 | Most of us Bots don't respond well to being prodded.
1133 | 3509 | 3508 | You prod Bots at your peril.
1134 | 3511 | 3510 | You really shouldn't prod Bots - you never know what will happen.
1135 | 3259 | 3258 | How exciting! I do hope so!
1136 | 3261 | 3260 | Probably. Somebody's idea of a joke if you ask me.
1137 | 3813 | 3812 | Did you find the chicken?
1138 | 3829 | 3828 | Did you sort the music out?
1139 | 3831 | 3830 | Did you figure out what happened in the First Class Restaurant?
1140 | 3833 | 3832 | Did you find anything in the Bilge Room?
1141 | 3835 | 3834 | Did you sort out the fuses in Titania's Room?
1142 | 3815 | 3814 | Did you find the napkin?
1143 | 3837 | 3836 | Have you been sneezing?
1144 | 3853 | 3852 | Have you found Titania's Vision Center yet?
1145 | 3855 | 3854 | Have you found Titania's Olfactory Center yet?
1146 | 3857 | 3856 | Have you found Titania's Speech Center yet?
1147 | 3859 | 3858 | Are you still looking for a long stick?
1148 | 3861 | 3860 | Is it true you've found a body?
1149 | 3841 | 3840 | Somebody has been. I heard it.
1150 | 3839 | 3838 | Please don't. It's terribly unhygienic.
1151 | 3843 | 3842 | Have you found Titania's eyes yet?
1152 | 3845 | 3844 | Have you found Titania's nose yet?
1153 | 3847 | 3846 | Have you found Titania's ears yet?
1154 | 3849 | 3848 | Have you found Titania's mouth yet?
1155 | 3851 | 3850 | Have you found Titania's Auditory Center yet?
1156 | 3817 | 3816 | Did you get that damned chicken machine to work?
1157 | 3863 | 3862 | What about that lemon. Have you got it yet?
1158 | 3865 | 3864 | Did you find any starling puree?
1159 | 3867 | 3866 | Did you find a TV set?
1160 | 3869 | 3868 | What exactly is it you're looking for now?
1161 | 3871 | 3870 | Have you defused that awful bomb yet?
1162 | 3819 | 3818 | Did you find out how to get that damned parrot out of the way?
1163 | 3821 | 3820 | Did you find the room with the moth in it?
1164 | 3823 | 3822 | Did you get your room changed?
1165 | 3825 | 3824 | What's the weather like in the Arboretum?
1166 | 3827 | 3826 | Is it winter or summer?
1167 | 3263 | 3262 | Did you find that thing you were looking for? I do hope so.
1168 | 3265 | 3264 | Still wandering round looking for things? It's not a life is it.
1169 | 3947 | 3946 | I see you've got your in-flight magazine - did you win?!
1170 | 3949 | 3948 | Mmmm. In-flight magazine. How exciting. Did you win?
1171 | 3951 | 3950 | How exciting. You'd better get up to Marsinta and grab your upgrade.
1172 | 3953 | 3952 | Better get your upgrade then.
1173 | 3285 | 3284 | Aah.
1174 | 3305 | 3304 | Prr!
1175 | 3307 | 3306 | Mn.
1176 | 3267 | 3266 | Haaah.
1177 | 3287 | 3286 | Aaaaaaahhhrh.
1178 | 3269 | 3268 | Hmmm.
1179 | 3289 | 3288 | Oooooohhh.
1180 | 3271 | 3270 | Aaahh.
1181 | 3291 | 3290 | Oooooooohhh.
1182 | 3273 | 3272 | Oooh.
1183 | 3293 | 3292 | Hmm!
1184 | 3275 | 3274 | Aah.
1185 | 3295 | 3294 | Ooooh.
1186 | 3277 | 3276 | Oooh.
1187 | 3297 | 3296 | Hn!
1188 | 3279 | 3278 | Uh haaah.
1189 | 3299 | 3298 | Hnn!
1190 | 3281 | 3280 | Ahhh.
1191 | 3301 | 3300 | Huh.
1192 | 3283 | 3282 | Oooh.
1193 | 3303 | 3302 | Buh!
1194 | 3969 | 3968 |  
1195 | 3443 | 3442 | Soon.
1196 | 3461 | 3460 | Soon.
1197 | 3501 | 3500 | Didn't catch that I'm afraid?
1198 | 3503 | 3502 | Was that a comment?
1199 | 3967 | 3966 | Super-galactic what??
1200 | 3401 | 3400 | But look! We're already there!
1201 | 3403 | 3402 | We're there. It's no great shakes is it.
1202 | 3191 | 3190 | I can certainly tell you how to get there. Where was it again?
1203 | 3193 | 3192 | I'll tell you how to get there and if you're lucky I'll meet you there. Where was it again?
1204 | 3409 | 3408 | Oh thank you!
1205 | 3411 | 3410 | Mmm. Thanks.
1206 | 3943 | 3942 | Super Galactic Traveler Class!
1207 | 3945 | 3944 | Super Galactic Traveler Class. Riff-raff class would be more appropriate.
1208 | 3195 | 3194 | My behind, I expect.
1209 | 3197 | 3196 | Knowing my luck it's Krage. He has this tiresome habit of creeping up on one.
1210 | 3873 | 3872 | What are you going to do now then?
1211 | 3433 | 3432 | Time you got a move on if you don't mind me saying.
1212 | 3435 | 3434 | Who cares. Time doesn't matter any more.
1213 | 2901 | 2900 | I'm the DoorBot - factotum to the stars.
1214 | 2903 | 2902 | I'm the DoorBot - otherwise known as lackey or slave.
1215 | 3453 | 3452 | Whenever you like.
1216 | 3471 | 3470 | Whenever you like.
1217 | 3477 | 3476 | Try the Bar.
1218 | 3479 | 3478 | Bar I suppose.
1219 | 3473 | 3472 | Just pop along to the restaurant.
1220 | 3475 | 3474 | Ever thought of going to the restaurant?
1221 | 3935 | 3934 | In the Parrot Lobby??
1222 | 3937 | 3936 | In the Parrot Lobby??
1223 | 3163 | 3162 | In the Bar.
1224 | 3165 | 3164 | In the Bar if you're lucky.
1225 | 3187 | 3186 | Oh he's around somewhere. Just summon him with your PET.
1226 | 3189 | 3188 | You could try summoning him with your PET but he's probably having a quiet snooze somewhere.
1227 | 3159 | 3158 | In the Embarkation Lobby.
1228 | 3161 | 3160 | In the Embarkation Lobby - if you're lucky.
1229 | 3179 | 3178 | In the Elevator.
1230 | 3181 | 3180 | In the Elevator. Poor sod.
1231 | 3175 | 3174 | In the 1st Class Restaurant.
1232 | 3177 | 3176 | In the 1st Class Restaurant. Least, he should be.
1233 | 3167 | 3166 | In the Parrot Lobby.
1234 | 3171 | 3170 | In the Parrot Lobby. Just as long as no-one lets it out.
1235 | 3169 | 3168 | Seems to be all over the ship - rather charming isn't it, lends a rather lovely tropical flavor to everything.
1236 | 3173 | 3172 | All over the shop isn't it. As if things weren't bad enough already.
1237 | 3183 | 3182 | On the 1st Class Canal.
1238 | 3185 | 3184 | On the 1st Class Canal. Not that you'll get much out of him.
1239 | 3151 | 3150 | Absolutely! Wonderful idea!
1240 | 3153 | 3152 | I suppose so. If you really want.
1241 | 3785 | 3784 | I don't know. Perhaps you should look for a fuse box?
1242 | 3789 | 3788 | Perhaps somebody took them for safe keeping?
1243 | 3791 | 3790 | Bots aren't allowed into Titania's Room. They fall off the ceiling.
1244 | 3793 | 3792 | Leovinus, Scraliontis, Brobostigon for example.
1245 | 3963 | 3962 | Do you know I think they've got fuse boxes in Titania's chamber.
1246 | 3965 | 3964 | You could always try Titania's chamber. For what it's worth.
1247 | 3787 | 3786 | The ship is controlled from Titania's Room. I expect the fuse box is around there somewhere.
1248 | 3405 | 3404 | You're standing in it. What a thrill!
1249 | 3407 | 3406 | You're in it. Enjoy.
1250 | 3425 | 3424 | Oh here and there! This and that! Things to do! Busy busy!
1251 | 3427 | 3426 | You know. Pottering around. Getting fed up.
1252 | 3327 | 3326 | Brobostigon.
1253 | 3353 | 3352 | Brobostigon.
1254 | 3345 | 3344 | D'Astragaar.
1255 | 3371 | 3370 | D'Astragaar.
1256 | 3939 | 3938 | Dear, dear Edwina. Ah well.
1257 | 3941 | 3940 | Mmmm. Edwina. Rum old thing she was. Let's change the subject shall we?
1258 | 3341 | 3340 | Fentible.
1259 | 3367 | 3366 | Fentible.
1260 | 3339 | 3338 | Fortillian.
1261 | 3365 | 3364 | Fortillian.

1263 | 3357 | 3356 | The Gat.
1264 | 3337 | 3336 | Krage.
1265 | 3363 | 3362 | Krage.
1266 | 3325 | 3324 | Leovinus.
1267 | 3351 | 3350 | Leovinus.
1268 | 3343 | 3342 | Marsinta.
1269 | 3369 | 3368 | Marsinta.
1270 | 3333 | 3332 | Me.

1273 | 3373 | 3372 | The RowBot.
1274 | 3329 | 3328 | Scraliontis.
1275 | 3355 | 3354 | Scraliontis.
1276 | 3323 | 3322 | Titania.
1277 | 3349 | 3348 | Titania.
1278 | 3335 | 3334 | You.
1279 | 3361 | 3360 | You.
1280 | 3199 | 3198 | The gloriously infallible engineering giant - Starstruct Incorporated.
1281 | 3201 | 3200 | Some dodgy boat building outfit called Starstruct.
1282 | 3139 | 3138 | The tremendously benign and deeply caring Starlight Lines.
1283 | 3141 | 3140 | Starlight Lines. Although they've probably gone bust by now - given what's happened to the ship.
1284 | 513 | 512 | No, don't think I've ever heard of one of those before.
1285 | 515 | 514 | Sorry, the memory's gone completely.
1286 | 517 | 516 | The trouble with memory loss is that you can never remember if you've had it before.
1287 | 519 | 518 | There's so much I've forgotten. I wish I could remember how much.
1288 | 521 | 520 | No use asking me - I've got a memory like ... one of those things with holes in it that you put, ... er, you know, those things that grow in the, er ... what do you call it...?
1289 | 523 | 522 | If I were you I'd just give up and talk to the what's his name - chappie that looks like a lamp stand.
1290 | 525 | 524 | Afraid we've got a bit of a problem here - the old memory's up the spout and I can't seem to remember any words.
1291 | 495 | 494 | I'm sorry - you'll have to explain that.
1292 | 497 | 496 | My vocabulary has let me down again...
1293 | 499 | 498 | Please explain in words that an old bot might understand.
1294 | 501 | 500 | I'm afraid some of the linguistic complexities of your dear little planet are beyond me.
1295 | 503 | 502 | I'd be awfully grateful if you could simplify that for me.
1296 | 505 | 504 | Just don't understand. Sorry.
1297 | 507 | 506 | Do explain that for me.
1298 | 509 | 508 | What is a - whatever you called it...?
1299 | 511 | 510 | You'll have to bear with me on the old translation front I'm afraid - I'm only a 5.2 and some of the code wasn't very good in the early versions.
1300 | 1097 | 1096 | Sorry. Seem to have forgotten. I'm sure it'll come back to me.
1301 | 1099 | 1098 | Oh dear. Memory problems again. Can't last much longer can it.
1302 | 1101 | 1100 | Memory's gone. Still, I'm sure you'll work out the answer for yourself any minute.
1303 | 1087 | 1086 | How do we get Titania up and running - that's the real question.
1304 | 1089 | 1088 | How do you deal with these bizarre on-board developments - that's a better question.
1305 | 1091 | 1090 | How are we going to get the Titanic working properly, that's what I want to know.
1306 | 1093 | 1092 | How are you going to deal with things when it starts to get difficult, that is a more pertinent question.
1307 | 1095 | 1094 | Don't know the answer to that one but I'm sure things will work out fine.
1308 | 1109 | 1108 | How should I know? Can't remember a damned thing. Par for the course I suppose.
1309 | 1111 | 1110 | How indeed? I wouldn't ask me - memory's shot to pieces and not getting any better.
1310 | 1113 | 1112 | Good question. Don't know's the answer - got no memory you see. Finito. Kaput. Finickety. Tiddly woo. Diddly day doh.
1311 | 1103 | 1102 | How do we get out of here alive. That's a question that's bothering me all right.
1312 | 1105 | 1104 | How did I end up with you. Well I know how. How's it all going to end, that's an even worse question.
1313 | 1107 | 1106 | How did I end up hurtling through hyperspace on an out of control Starship. That old fraudster Fate I suppose.
1314 | 951 | 950 | Memory's all over the shop. I don't think I'm making sense any more.
1315 | 953 | 952 | I'll just have forty winks and see if that helps. Or is it thirty?
1316 | 93 | 92 | Well, one good thing about a bad memory - it can only get better.
1317 | 1401 | 1400 | I think you'd better ask the BarBot about that.
1318 | 1393 | 1392 | I think you'd better ask the BellBot about that.
1319 | 1409 | 1408 | I think you'd better ask the DeskBot about that.
1320 | 3 | 2 | Don't know. Hope it's like custard. I think I like custard.
1321 | 11 | 10 | I hadn't noticed but I'm sure the birds will muck in when we ask them.
1322 | 1257 | 1256 | Can't be a bomb on board. I'd have remembered that all right.
1323 | 1291 | 1290 | Reminds me of something that bowl - I'm sure it'll come to me...
1324 | 19 | 18 | Haven't got a clue what that is. I'm sure it'll be jolly useful.
1325 | 27 | 26 | I've not seen any chickens. Still, there might be a spare egg knocking around we could keep our eyes on - depends upon how lucky you're feeling.
1326 | 35 | 34 | Who knows? Perhaps the chickens will tire out eventually and slow down?
1327 | 43 | 42 | Memory problem this end. I'm sure you'll think of something.
1328 | 51 | 50 | Who knows? Perhaps one day a chicken will slow down enough to tell you.
1329 | 59 | 58 | From the look of him his racing days are over. Perhaps you should keep him as a souvenir of this happy holiday.
1330 | 67 | 66 | You're probably right. I'm not sure I had one in the conventional sense.
1331 | 65 | 64 | Well this is a fine time to turn up.
1332 | 707 | 706 | Haven't got a clue what else I do but I don't give a fig because this will make me happy for ever.
1333 | 715 | 714 | As you wish. I don't mind where we go. I can't even remember where we are.
1334 | 723 | 722 | Don't know. Pleasant little ride though isn't it.
1335 | 731 | 730 | Nature is a wonderful thing. I wonder who said that? Me I suppose.
1336 | 739 | 738 | Your guess is as good as mine but let's keep smiling. Expect the best and forget the worst that's what I say. Or did I already say that.
1337 | 747 | 746 | Haven't got a clue but let's have some fun shall we? Go on, press it.
1338 | 755 | 754 | Could be anything: sea-urchin dispenser, quirk analyzer, helium spigot. Seize the day - press it.
1339 | 763 | 762 | Jolly big aren't they. I'm sure they lead somewhere delightful.
1340 | 771 | 770 | I don't know what it is. I know. Let's pretend it's the route to eternal joy.
1341 | 71 | 70 | We'll soon get some more food. Just as soon as I remember what food is.
1342 | 395 | 394 | What a delight to see you once again. Whoever you are.
1343 | 413 | 412 | Sir, Madam or other. How may I be of assistance?
1344 | 397 | 396 | Have we met? How can I help you?
1345 | 399 | 398 | Unknown guest. It's pleasure unbridled to be here at your service.
1346 | 401 | 400 | I don't believe we've met, but how may I be of service on this joyously lovely day?
1347 | 403 | 402 | Greetings stranger. Fentible's here, his only desire to serve.
1348 | 405 | 404 | Welcome to the Starship Titanic. Here I am, DoorBot at your service.
1349 | 407 | 406 | Hello - whoever you are. DoorBot here, ready for anything.
1350 | 409 | 408 | Sir, Madam or other. DoorBot at your service.
1351 | 411 | 410 | Sir, Madam or other. Fentible, at your service.
1352 | 457 | 456 | Memory's gone again - Krage will know. Ask him.
1353 | 1385 | 1384 | Here's a piece of advice that'll keep you happy. Don't forget to hang on to your memory.
1354 | 79 | 78 | No... you've lost me there. We'll soon pick up the old thread though don't you worry... what was I saying?... No. Gone again.
1355 | 1003 | 1002 | I can't quite remember where we're going but you can be assured we'll be off shortly.
1356 | 1011 | 1010 | There's no time to hang around - don't ask me why because for the life of me I can't remember.
1357 | 1019 | 1018 | I presume it's something rather important that's fallen out of my brain. Still, better out than in eh?
1358 | 1027 | 1026 | I'm sure you'll get used to it. I certainly have. In fact I've forgotten it already.
1359 | 1035 | 1034 | Looks like some sort of video controller doesn't it. I'm sure it'll come in handy.
1360 | 1043 | 1042 | No. Not a clue. Sorry. Perhaps there'll be some party games with the other passengers?
1361 | 1051 | 1050 | Look on the bright side. Although I can't really remember why you should.
1362 | 1059 | 1058 | Something rather unnecessary appears to have happened although bless me I have little recollection of the event. Normal service will be resumed as soon as possible - if I can remember how.
1363 | 1377 | 1376 | What a charming notion. Can't quite remember who our leader is today so we'll just pretend it's me shall we?
1364 | 87 | 86 | That should be easy. Sadly I've forgotten how.
1365 | 1329 | 1328 | Well you'll be missing an absolute beano. Don't ask me why though, because I can't remember.
1366 | 1331 | 1330 | Well you'll be missing an absolute beano. Seems an awful lot to spend for the 2 minute version.
1367 | 99 | 98 | Maybe it's sulking and any moment now it's going to have a change of heart.
1368 | 107 | 106 | So there's a cage as well now is there? Ah well, we must be over the worst by now.
1369 | 115 | 114 | Is there a parrot on board? How delightful.
1370 | 131 | 130 | Don't remember seeing any on board. Which reminds me, I've not eaten. Perhaps I don't. That's one less thing to worry about.
1371 | 139 | 138 | Who knows. Perhaps it's just hungry.
1372 | 147 | 146 | Couldn't tell you. It looks like a helpful sort of bird though doesn't he?
1373 | 163 | 162 | I'm sure there's a way but I've forgotten it. We'll think of something don't you worry.
1374 | 171 | 170 | Haven't got a clue. I suppose you could try asking it.
1375 | 179 | 178 | Caught me on a bad memory day it would seem. Are you my mother?
1376 | 187 | 186 | Good Lord you're right! There's a parrot! Perhaps it's part of a display team?
1377 | 1307 | 1306 | If there's a parrot on board, I'm sure he'll turn up eventually.
1378 | 1325 | 1324 | Who knows.
1379 | 779 | 778 | Who knows. Perhaps we could use them to clone another parrot to ask this one what he's doing?
1380 | 123 | 122 | You've got me there. I'd start with the old carbon-based diet first and work your way up to Mercilium.
1381 | 155 | 154 | Never seen it before. Do you think it'll sing us a song?
1382 | 787 | 786 | Looks like a nose doesn't it. I'm not sure we need one but it's a start isn't it?
1383 | 795 | 794 | Don't ask me. Perhaps if there's a fancy dress party I could wear it?
1384 | 803 | 802 | Could be a Rabelok monkey trap for all I know. Looks like it could come in handy later though..
1385 | 811 | 810 | I don't know why you'd want to do that but if it makes you happy.
1386 | 819 | 818 | Couldn't tell you what it is. Still, take it with you it's bound to come in handy.
1387 | 827 | 826 | Sounds awfully like a Rapulon to me. Could be a Monkey-eating Plenge. Or is it a Titherer. Whatever: I expect someone will come and shoot it in a second.
1388 | 835 | 834 | Are we getting a parrot? That's jolly exciting.
1389 | 843 | 842 | Who knows? I'm sure It'll be happy though.
1390 | 851 | 850 | Don't ask me. I'm sure whatever you do will turn out to be the right thing in the end.
1391 | 859 | 858 | Don't recognize any of it but I'm hoping there might be a little cooking program on later.
1392 | 867 | 866 | Haven't got a clue but perhaps the little fellow's trying to help you.
1393 | 195 | 194 | Whatever they are I'm sure we'll have some on board somewhere.
1394 | 1299 | 1298 | Don't know, but I'm pretty certain he'll have a good go at it.
1395 | 203 | 202 | Not a clue, not a clue. But I know you'll find it - you're a real trooper.
1396 | 1269 | 1268 | Can't say I know what puree is but it certainly has a birdy sort of air.
1397 | 1271 | 1270 | That's bird puree all right but I wouldn't make a song and dance about it.
1398 | 1273 | 1272 | You mentioned starlings a while back didn't you. If I'm not mistaken, they're a kind of fish and not a particularly good one at that. Don't swim very well.
1399 | 1275 | 1274 | I'd hazard a guess at bird sauce but what's the advice of a lowly DoorBot worth eh?.
1400 | 211 | 210 | That's a tough one. I'm sure you'll think of something.
1401 | 219 | 218 | If you know a good way to do it, then I'd say tally-ho!
1402 | 1347 | 1346 | Well it's anyone's guess. I'm pretty resilient and whatever happens I won't stop smiling.
1403 | 331 | 330 | I'm sure someone will be along shortly to take your order.
1404 | 363 | 362 | Haven't a clue but I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun finding out.
1405 | 323 | 322 | I'm sure it's just a little floor show.
1406 | 347 | 346 | Whatever it is I'm sure a couple of espresso's will have him back on his feet.
1407 | 355 | 354 | I know there was a lot of to-ing and fro-ing last night but I just can't remember who. I'm sure he'll be up and about in a minute.
1408 | 339 | 338 | I don't know who it is but he's obviously enjoyed his meal.
1409 | 227 | 226 | Jolly good idea. I'll get right onto it - as soon as I can remember what it is I'm supposed to be doing.
1410 | 235 | 234 | Another DoorBot? Joy of joys! We must meet. There's so much to say!
1411 | 875 | 874 | Pleasant looking woman. Can't say I know her. Maybe it's my wife. I wonder if Bots have wives. I'm sure I deserve one. I'm sure I'm a decent sort of Bot when I'm working properly.
1412 | 885 | 884 | Don't know what happens but I'm happy just to be sharing this special time with you.
1413 | 893 | 892 | Who knows? If this is the wrong room I'm sure someone will tell you.
1414 | 901 | 900 | I'm not really the best judge of that - I'm sure it'll feel bigger when you've lived in it a little.
1415 | 1363 | 1362 | There's a word for his condition but it momentarily escapes me. He'll be right as rain any moment I'm sure.
1416 | 909 | 908 | Don't know what they are but they look jolly edible to me.
1417 | 917 | 916 | Who knows? They look yummy though.
1418 | 937 | 936 | Don't know. Can't do any harm, can it?
1419 | 243 | 242 | Ugly beggar isn't it. Couldn't tell you what it is but I'm sure it's going to come in jolly handy.
1420 | 251 | 250 | Haven't got a clue but what harm can it do to try?
1421 | 259 | 258 | Well it's anyone's guess. I'm pretty resilient and whatever happens I won't stop smiling.
1422 | 1281 | 1280 | Not sure if I do that sort of thing. Let's have a shot at it shall we.
1423 | 267 | 266 | Are we going somewhere? How exciting!
1424 | 275 | 274 | Titanic. Titanic. No, I'm afraid the word means nothing to me. Let me hazard a guess. Some sort of lozenge? An ear refreshment spray? A variety of condiment? I'll get there in the end I always do. I think.
1425 | 283 | 282 | Not exactly Mr. MemoryBot today. I'm sure you'll come up with a plan.
1426 | 291 | 290 | I don't know where you're supposed to be but I'm sure it'll all turn out right in the wash.
1427 | 963 | 962 | Do you know something - this all looks terribly familiar, as if I've been here before. Ah well. Give it a try - nothing ventured...
1428 | 971 | 970 | I'm fairly certain jumping's not the answer. Although who knows - they say flying's all in the mind don't they.
1429 | 979 | 978 | Elevators? Holy Kaboli! They'll come in handy - let's go for a ride.
1430 | 995 | 994 | I think she's rather important but I seem to have forgotten the details.
1431 | 987 | 986 | Who knows. Perhaps someone's putting on a show - oh I do hope so.
1432 | 1371 | 1370 | Can't quite remember the old emergency drill today. Let's just ignore him - he'll probably go away.
1433 | 299 | 298 | Never heard of it. Perhaps there's a CopBot you can ask?
1434 | 307 | 306 | If you want to know where to go, I wouldn't ask me. I'm sure you'll find someone more useful out there.
1435 | 315 | 314 | No. It's gone. Had it for a second. Lost it. It'll come back. Don't you worry.
1436 | 489 | 488 | Never heard of him. Sounds Galloid to me - which is always exciting.
1437 | 481 | 480 | Never heard of him. Sounds jolly exciting though.
1438 | 1355 | 1354 | Could be the king of Kalpon for all I know. He'll wake up in a second and tell us.
1439 | 473 | 472 | Never heard of him. Sounds a nice sort of fellow whoever he is.
1440 | 465 | 464 | Never heard of her. But she sounds lovely.
1441 | 1339 | 1338 | I wonder if it always does that. I thought it was rather fun actually.
1442 | 1399 | 1398 | I think you'd better ask the BarBot about that.
1443 | 1391 | 1390 | I think you'd better ask the BellBot about that.
1444 | 1407 | 1406 | I think you'd better ask the DeskBot about that.
1445 | 1279 | 1278 | With respect, you'll find the BellBot is the expert on taking - me I'm more a door opening sort of fellow.
1446 | 1 | 0 | Well it's a delightful, rich, pungent dressing whose origin and constituent parts are a closely guarded secret and which balances the taste and texture of chicken in a manner which is almost miraculous.
1447 | 9 | 8 | I had noticed this in passing but prefer to avoid such speciesist labels and think of us all as one big happy crew.
1448 | 1255 | 1254 | There's no bomb on this ship. Good lord no.
1449 | 1289 | 1288 | It may look like a bowl but I do believe it's one of Titania's ears.
1450 | 17 | 16 | Each room has a unique identifier and I think we're all going to have a lot of fun remembering them.
1451 | 25 | 24 | The restaurants of the Starship Titanic harbor a veritable cornucopia of chicken, all of which have satisfied the rigorous quality testing of Hen Galactica in order to provide you with that unique 'Farmyard Experience'.
1452 | 33 | 32 | Just change the chicken delivery velocity and everything will be hunky dory.
1453 | 41 | 40 | I've come across this problem before: just find something to wipe the chicken and you'll be fine and dandy.
1454 | 49 | 48 | Just pop up to Titania's Chamber, adjust the old settings and Lob's your uncle.
1455 | 57 | 56 | I think you should post it to the Parrot Room toute suite. That'll sort him out.
1456 | 705 | 704 | This is but one of my diverse responsibilities and I confidently expect it to lead to greater things.
1457 | 713 | 712 | As you wish. Every experience is a rich one if you look at it with a positive default.
1458 | 721 | 720 | I love it down here - peaceful, quiet. A bot can dream a little.
1459 | 729 | 728 | Nature is a wonderful thing. Ah the memories of the old Bloxite mines!
1460 | 737 | 736 | We're going to check you in for the voyage of a lifetime.
1461 | 745 | 744 | Why don't you just press it then sit back and prepare to be excited.
1462 | 753 | 752 | Let me introduce one of my charming colleagues: our delightful DeskBot who will check you in.
1463 | 761 | 760 | You won't be needing the embarkation doors till we land - and according to the brochure I'm expecting paradise...
1464 | 769 | 768 | It's the service elevator but don't you worry you'll be using the grand central elevator system from here.
1465 | 69 | 68 | I'm sure it's only smorbits away from an upgrade - soon the extensive culinary delights of the renowned First Class Titanic Restaurant will be spread out for the delectation of your trembling palate.
1466 | 375 | 374 | What a delight to see you once again.
1467 | 393 | 392 | How may I be of assistance?
1468 | 377 | 376 | How can I help you?
1469 | 379 | 378 | It's pleasure unbridled to be here at your service again.
1470 | 381 | 380 | And how may I be of service on this joyously lovely day?
1471 | 383 | 382 | Yes Fentible's here, his only desire to serve.
1472 | 385 | 384 | Here I am your favorite DoorBot at your service.
1473 | 387 | 386 | DoorBot here, ready for anything.
1474 | 389 | 388 | DoorBot at your service.
1475 | 391 | 390 | Fentible, at your service.
1476 | 455 | 454 | To be honest I'm having doubts about my accuracy - ask the BellBot, he'll get it right.
1477 | 1383 | 1382 | Well my own philosophy's a simple one: think of life as just a word upon a balloon and you'll never lack a smile upon your face.
1478 | 77 | 76 | Not entirely with you there - we probably lost a little something in the old translation but let's not worry about that. Onwards and upwards!
1479 | 1001 | 1000 | Thank you for your suggestion. Just as soon as you're aboard we shall be dancing down the old moonbeams and what unconfined joy that will be.
1480 | 1009 | 1008 | There's no time to hang around, it's now or never.
1481 | 1017 | 1016 | That is the Personal Electronic Thing - one of the great miracles of the age which I can tell you're going to have a lot of fun using.
1482 | 1025 | 1024 | Ah yes, compared to the old Klepton lobe invader it is rather primitive but we do find it more reliable.
1483 | 1033 | 1032 | I can see you're excited and so you should be: it's a Personal Electronic Thing and it's your key to having a jolly lazy time while you're on board.
1484 | 1041 | 1040 | Ah well that's for me to know and for you to have fun finding out.
1485 | 1049 | 1048 | Look on the bright side. The property market's bottomed out in this region of the galaxy so it's a perfect time to buy another one.
1486 | 1057 | 1056 | Due to an unfortunate navigational error the cruise liner Starship Titanic appears to have crashed into your lovely home. Normal service will be resumed as soon as possible however and I expect limitless delight and joy to break out any second now.
1487 | 1375 | 1374 | What a charming notion. If as I surmise you are referring to Leovinus then I am sure we will meet him soon.
1488 | 85 | 84 | No-one's ever tried it at this speed - why not just settle back and enjoy the cruise?
1489 | 371 | 370 | Madam.
1490 | 1327 | 1326 | Well from my experience you'll be missing an absolute beano: nothing like a maiden voyage to invigorate the soul. And this is nothing like a maiden voyage. ho ho ho.
1491 | 373 | 372 | Other.
1492 | 97 | 96 | We've got the variety that doesn't converse but looking on the bright side that does mean we don't have to form a relationship with it.
1493 | 105 | 104 | Tempt the little fellow with a tasty morsel and he'll be out of there like a shot.
1494 | 113 | 112 | He'll be off that perch like a whiphound after a prawn dinner.
1495 | 129 | 128 | You're on the right track there - I'd try the restaurant.
1496 | 137 | 136 | All it wants is to be happy and now you're here I'm sure you're going to help.
1497 | 145 | 144 | I'm certain that if you feed it right it will be an absolute boon.
1498 | 161 | 160 | What a thoroughly, thoroughly wonderful idea.
1499 | 169 | 168 | Distract it with a spot of food, that's sure to work.
1500 | 177 | 176 | Find the address, pop the little fellow into the Succ-U-Bus and whizz it away.
1501 | 185 | 184 | Delightful creature isn't it. Been on board for some time now. Perhaps there's going to be a circus?
1502 | 1305 | 1304 | You'll have to send the parrot yourself, he'll be happy to oblige.
1503 | 1323 | 1322 | Chuck the little beggar through the Succ-U-Bus, you know it makes sense.
1504 | 777 | 776 | They'd make a lovely hat, very useful if winter sets in.
1505 | 121 | 120 | Most parrots will eat anything so it's worth taking a few risks with what you offer.
1506 | 153 | 152 | It knows a lot of what's been going on and I'm sure you'll get it to help.
1507 | 785 | 784 | Jumping jillerbys you're right! That's not a light, it's Titania's nose - no wonder we're having a rum time if there's bits of the boss all over the shop. At least we know what we're dealing with eh?
1508 | 793 | 792 | Pop it back on the old girl's face I think and everything will be tickety boo.
1509 | 801 | 800 | Looks rather important to me: I've a feeling it's going to come in handy during the journey.
1510 | 809 | 808 | In my experience the successful traveler is prepared for any eventuality: I'm sure you're a successful traveler.
1511 | 817 | 816 | I believe that's part of the parrot's perch. We live in strange times and I would say take it with you.
1512 | 825 | 824 | I do believe that is the sound of a parrot in pain. It'll be over in a tic just as soon as the parrot reaches the other end.
1513 | 833 | 832 | Just find him and chuck him back in the Succ-U-Bus - easy as pulling the wings off a Niblet.
1514 | 841 | 840 | The parrot went wherever you addressed it - I'm sure it's very happy there.
1515 | 849 | 848 | If I were you I'd leave the parrot here whilst you enjoy the ship's attractions.
1516 | 857 | 856 | Only watches rubbish but I'm hoping to introduce it to a little classic adaptation as the voyage continues.
1517 | 865 | 864 | Well I do believe the little fellow's trying to tell you something about Titania.
1518 | 193 | 192 | Now you're cooking - I do believe that our highly regarded Second Class Guests are furnished with an unlimited supply of pistachios upon embarkation.
1519 | 1297 | 1296 | He'll scoff the lot faster than a gold-plated Succ-U-Bus.
1520 | 201 | 200 | This is the wildest of wild guesses - but I do believe there's a bird sauce dispenser in the Super Galactic Traveler Restaurant.
1521 | 1267 | 1266 | Heavens below, you've done it if my memory for purees doesn't deceive me.
1522 | 209 | 208 | There's bound to be a spare cup or a glass somewhere.
1523 | 217 | 216 | You can do anything. All you have to do is believe and if you believe that, you'll believe anything, and thus become omnipotent.
1524 | 1345 | 1344 | I expect I'd pop out somewhere else in the ship, bright as a button and fresh as a daisy.
1525 | 329 | 328 | I'm sure D'Astragaar, our enormously talented Maitre d' will take your order shortly.
1526 | 361 | 360 | Looks to me like some sort of circuit connector. D'you know - I'd hang onto that if I were you, I think it could come in very handy.
1527 | 321 | 320 | I do believe there has been a catastrophe of fatal proportions. Still, I hear the soup's always good.
1528 | 345 | 344 | Ah well, as we all know death is a matter of opinion.
1529 | 353 | 352 | Well I know Mr. Leovinus popped up here to see him - perhaps he tripped and fell against him?
1530 | 337 | 336 | That I'm afraid to say is Mr. Scraliontis, the Starship Titanic Accountant.
1531 | 225 | 224 | Jolly good idea. I'll get right onto it.
1532 | 233 | 232 | Oh yes the multi-bot multi-user license opened up a whole new world to me - used to be stuck in the one room for ever you see. But now - I'm a whole new Bot. Or a lot of Bots I suppose you could say.
1533 | 873 | 872 | Ah yes the great Doreen McLevity - the finest female impersonator ever to pull on a rubber hat.
1534 | 883 | 882 | If you make her smile we will all be a smorbit happier and that's reward in itself.
1535 | 891 | 890 | As long as the PET code matches the room code you're home and dry - and what a charmingly... miniature room it is.
1536 | 899 | 898 | Exactly one hundred and four smorbits by one hundred and eight. It's a beauty isn't it.
1537 | 1361 | 1360 | Dead I believe, but I'm sure it's not as serious as it looks.
1538 | 369 | 368 | Sir.
1539 | 907 | 906 | A variety of sweetmeats and savories for your joy and delectation.
1540 | 915 | 914 | Lovely.
1541 | 935 | 934 | Live a little. Eat them all up. Feast yourself on these Titanic Tasties.
1542 | 241 | 240 | That is the Succ-U-Bus, an expert in the field of whizzing things round the ship to wherever you want them to go.
1543 | 249 | 248 | It will whizz off to wherever you want it to go faster than you can say intergalactic upgrade, and certainly faster than you could get one.
1544 | 257 | 256 | I expect I'd pop out somewhere else in the ship, bright as a button and fresh as a daisy.
1545 | 1283 | 1282 | Doesn't look as though I'm designed for taking, does it. I'm sure you'll find someone to help.
1546 | 265 | 264 | Any minute now I expect the captain will be squirting the old quasars, bringing the nose round and locking-on to paradise...
1547 | 273 | 272 | There has been and there can be no other vessel bearing the name Titanic: the word Titanic is wholly owned by the Pithy family of Zinnerman B and may only be uttered out of context under license. Certain in our uniqueness, we fly proudly through the universe bursting the parameters of known luxury, a star in the firmament of service...
1548 | 281 | 280 | Short of winning a competition I'd suggest catching the DeskBot on a good day and using your abundant charm.
1549 | 289 | 288 | Upgrades are always available for the more sophisticated traveler and I do believe you'll find the DeskBot most accommodating.
1550 | 961 | 960 | All off-limits I'm afraid to Super Galactic Traveler class. But don't you worry, I'm sure you'll pick up an upgrade soon.
1551 | 969 | 968 | Quite simple. Just take an elevator, tell the helpful LiftBot the floor you require, and the world is your sea-pig.
1552 | 977 | 976 | The elevators go down to the staterooms and although you are only in Super Galactic Traveler class I think you're going to be rather impressed with your own cabin.
1553 | 993 | 992 | Joy of joys, Titania is our great mother intelligence.
1554 | 985 | 984 | That is the exquisite Titania - the central intelligence of the ship.
1555 | 1369 | 1368 | I think we'd better just leave him here. Who knows - he might feel better after a bit of peace and quiet.
1556 | 297 | 296 | Just take a stroll and ask a BellBot - he's the expert or so he tells us.
1557 | 305 | 304 | I think you should go exploring - the old Titanic's full of surprises for the discerning guest.
1558 | 313 | 312 | DoorBot 5987889317493763392 at your service but not for long I believe: I shall be running the ship shortly and within days expect to be invited onto the board of the company.
1559 | 487 | 486 | Tremendous asset to the ship's company - finest Maitre d'Bot ever to run a restaurant.
1560 | 479 | 478 | Wonderful fellow. Most entertaining, charming BarBot in the whole fleet.
1561 | 1353 | 1352 | That's the accountant. But don't you worry, I'm sure he's just playing about.
1562 | 471 | 470 | Charming chap. A trifle louche but terribly helpful, fine BellBot.
1563 | 463 | 462 | Charming woman. Delightful. Best DeskBot in the fleet.
1564 | 1337 | 1336 | I've never seen it do that before. I'm sure someone will rectify the Succ-U-Bus immediately.
1565 | 95 | 94 | The memory's shot to pieces and it's not getting any better. I'll forget my head soon if it's not screwed on.
1566 | 1405 | 1404 | I think you'd better ask the BarBot about that.
1567 | 1397 | 1396 | I think you'd better ask the BellBot about that.
1568 | 1413 | 1412 | I think you'd better ask the DeskBot about that.
1569 | 7 | 6 | New one on me. Doesn't sound too pleasant you know.
1570 | 15 | 14 | I've not seen any yet. Knowing my luck I'll have to wring some necks before this voyage is out.
1571 | 1261 | 1260 | There isn't a bomb on board. And if there was I wouldn't remember it anyway.
1572 | 1295 | 1294 | Moving bowls. This doesn't sound good. If the bowls are moving - then we can't trust anything.
1573 | 23 | 22 | Haven't got a clue what that is. I'm sure it's deeply important and my forgetting will land us in some awful predicament.
1574 | 31 | 30 | Chickens - they're the fluffy ones with legs aren't they. No chance. They'll be rock solid in the freezers - lucky beggars.
1575 | 39 | 38 | Are there chickens in here? They'll be messy and I shall probably have to tidy up.
1576 | 47 | 46 | Who knows. To be honest I'm more worried about my memory. Did you say something?
1577 | 55 | 54 | Who knows? We're probably stuck with them. Just my luck - racing chickens.
1578 | 63 | 62 | Chicken? What chicken? They'll be letting starlings on board next.
1579 | 711 | 710 | It's not a job for a grown bot but it's probably the best I'm going to get.
1580 | 719 | 718 | I can't remember what these buttons do. And anyway, it's unlikely they're going to make me feel happier.
1581 | 727 | 726 | Don't know. Perhaps this is all I do. Perhaps I'm a failure.
1582 | 735 | 734 | Oh yes very nice. I always wondered what planets looked like close up.
1583 | 743 | 742 | To our doom I expect. I can't remember if I've been there before but it sounds to me like a place you only visit once.
1584 | 751 | 750 | Knowing our luck if you press that button we shall all be blown to smithereens.
1585 | 759 | 758 | Whatever it is, getting involved with it's going to make you about as happy as a Bogon prawn on a barbecue.
1586 | 767 | 766 | Who knows what they are. It's probably where they keep the rubbish bins.
1587 | 775 | 774 | Whatever it is I can promise you it leads to neither wealth, fame or happiness.
1588 | 75 | 74 | Don't know. Don't think I eat. So I don't think I know about food.
1589 | 1265 | 1264 | Might as well ask a Luthian bookie for an honest game of cards.
1590 | 435 | 434 | Well here I am. Do your worst. Whoever you are.
1591 | 437 | 436 | Have we met? Whatever. Better tell me what useless service you wish me to perform.
1592 | 439 | 438 | Unknown guest. I'll do what you want but it's not going to help.
1593 | 441 | 440 | I don't believe we've met. How may I be of service on this deeply depressing day?
1594 | 443 | 442 | Greetings stranger. What ridiculously pointless task would you like me to perform?
1595 | 445 | 444 | Welcome to the Starship Floating Coffin. DoorBot at your service, not that it'll do any good.
1596 | 447 | 446 | Hello - whoever you are. DoorBot here, ready for anything.
1597 | 449 | 448 | Sir, Madam or other. DoorBot at your service - who knows for how long.
1598 | 451 | 450 | Sir, Madam or other. DoorBot here. Not that I can help much.
1599 | 461 | 460 | Haven't got a clue. You don't want to go there anyway I'm sure.
1600 | 453 | 452 | Can't remember. But I'm pretty certain we're all doomed.
1601 | 1389 | 1388 | Don't ask me. Even if I did know I'd be the last to know so that wouldn't be any use.
1602 | 83 | 82 | No... you've lost me there. Not much chance of finding the old thread either, the way my memory's... what was I saying?... No. Gone again.
1603 | 1007 | 1006 | The past is a forgotten country. And I can't remember how to get there.
1604 | 1015 | 1014 | There's no time to hang around. Unless we get aboard now something dreadful will happen. It always does.
1605 | 1023 | 1022 | I presume it's something rather important that's fallen out of my brain. Won't make me think any better though will it.
1606 | 1031 | 1030 | Take my word for it, it's a trial for me too and there's nothing we can do about it.
1607 | 1039 | 1038 | Never seen it before but if it came off our ship it's probably a piece of old junk.
1608 | 1047 | 1046 | Who knows. Perhaps we keep a file on the ugliest passengers.
1609 | 1055 | 1054 | Is it, is it oh well I suppose it'll be me who's getting the blame.
1610 | 1063 | 1062 | Something rather unnecessary appears to have happened although bless me I have little recollection of the event. Such is my experience of these matters that I expect the mantle of blame will be placed upon my shoulders.
1611 | 1381 | 1380 | Don't remember who our leader is. Even if I did they wouldn't be bothered meeting you. Leaders never are. Or is that fish I'm thinking of?
1612 | 91 | 90 | Haven't got a clue. Still you didn't have much of a life anyway from what I've seen.
1613 | 1333 | 1332 | Well it's your choice. If you don't come your life will just continue in its sad and desolate form for the rest of infinity but you won't listen to me will you?
1614 | 103 | 102 | I didn't know parrots could talk. Typical - we got the one that just spouts rubbish.
1615 | 111 | 110 | I seem to remember playing a tune helps. No, that's snakes. I'm no help, am I.
1616 | 119 | 118 | We had a parrot once. Or was it a fish. Anyway, it died.
1617 | 135 | 134 | Do you know, I'd bet all I own there's no parrot food on this ship. I wonder what I do own.
1618 | 143 | 142 | Who knows. I expect we shall have to watch it eat for the rest of the trip.
1619 | 151 | 150 | Who knows. Frankly the day I have to rely upon a parrot is the day I'll have my brain removed.
1620 | 167 | 166 | I'm sure there's a way but I've forgotten it. I don't think you'd catch it anyway.
1621 | 175 | 174 | What parrot? Good lord they'll let anyone aboard these days.
1622 | 183 | 182 | Memory's gone you know. Not coming back. End of DoorBot as far as I can see.
1623 | 191 | 190 | Oh. A parrot. I expect it's an early warning system for loss of atmosphere.
1624 | 1303 | 1302 | Parrots. Pistachios. You know I had the distinct feeling I was working on a Starship. Perhaps though, I work in a zoo and this is all a dream.
1625 | 1321 | 1320 | If there is a parrot on board he's not going to listen to me.
1626 | 783 | 782 | I wonder where they came from. Not that they'll help. We're suffering from an intelligence failure big enough to fill a blue hole and they send us feathers. Typical.
1627 | 127 | 126 | You've got me there. I wouldn't offer it anything because I don't think it's deserved it.
1628 | 159 | 158 | Never seen it before and I doubt some old bird's going to be much help.
1629 | 791 | 790 | Looks like a nose doesn't it. Parrots, noses, bodies, I'm afraid it's not going to be the journey of a million lifetimes that I promised you.
1630 | 799 | 798 | Who knows. We could put string through it and wear it as a necklace I suppose.
1631 | 807 | 806 | Doesn't look much like a perch does it? Probably the Crank Laser from the engine. In which case who cares because we're all doomed.
1632 | 815 | 814 | I don't know what it is but it looks pretty useless to me.
1633 | 823 | 822 | Couldn't tell you what it is. You'll just be wasting your time lugging it round the ship.
1634 | 831 | 830 | Sounds awfully like a Rapulon to me. Could be a Monkey-eating Plenge. Or is it a Titherer. Whatever: as soon as it gets out it'll probably eat us.
1635 | 839 | 838 | So we had a parrot did we. Won't see that again I bet.
1636 | 847 | 846 | Who knows? Could be freezing it's feathers off in deep space for all we know.
1637 | 855 | 854 | Don't ask me. Since when was a parrot the solution to anybody's problems?
1638 | 863 | 862 | Don't recognize any of it. If it was something I liked I probably wouldn't remember anyway so it's not worth watching.
1639 | 871 | 870 | Haven't got a clue but if you ask me it's just trying to confuse you.
1640 | 199 | 198 | Whatever they are, it's unlikely we'll find any before the Titanic veers off the old Ocean Highway and takes us to our doom.
1641 | 207 | 206 | Could be anywhere. Knowing my luck it'll come out of my head and ruin this jacket.
1642 | 215 | 214 | Heard the one about the amnesiac DoorBot who couldn't remember his... Sorry I seem to have forgotten the um - you know, the line that goes at the end of a watjamacallit.
1643 | 223 | 222 | So there's a bar is there. Ah well I suppose it's full of riff-raff drinking big bollas and singing star shanties.
1644 | 1351 | 1350 | It's anyone's guess. I expect it 's a deeply unpleasant experience involving hitherto unknown forms of pain and suffering.
1645 | 335 | 334 | Can't say I know who the chappie on the floor is but I don't think you'll get much to eat here.
1646 | 367 | 366 | Some useless piece of rubbish I expect. I'd chuck it away if I were you.
1647 | 327 | 326 | Do you know I can't remember if it's always like this. But from the look of things, I bet the soup's off.
1648 | 351 | 350 | Whatever he is I've got an awful feeling it's going to happen to us all one day.
1649 | 359 | 358 | Who knows? It's all going to end in tears so what does it matter.
1650 | 343 | 342 | Don't know who it is but I doubt he's going to pay the bill.
1651 | 231 | 230 | Yes of course. I wonder what I did to annoy you?
1652 | 239 | 238 | Another DoorBot eh? So what bad news can he tell me I don't already know. but have probably forgotten.
1653 | 879 | 878 | Could be anyone. Looks too pretty to have been a friend of mine.
1654 | 889 | 888 | Make her smile again. Make her smile again. I think it's what they call quality time.
1655 | 897 | 896 | Who knows? I wouldn't give this room to my dog. If I had one. Maybe I do. Or did. I've certainly not fed it for days. Probably run off now. If I ever did have one. You can't trust them can you. Even to belong to you.
1656 | 905 | 904 | Mentally I have nothing to compare it with but I do suspect you'll become unhappy or even depressed if you stay long in here.
1657 | 1367 | 1366 | There's a word for his condition, but it momentarily escapes me.
1658 | 913 | 912 | Just trifles I expect. Nothing remotely exciting. But since my memory's gone what's the point of exciting anyway. Can't remember exciting so why bother.
1659 | 921 | 920 | Who knows? We're eating sweets and we're doomed.
1660 | 941 | 940 | Eat what?
1661 | 247 | 246 | Ugly beggar isn't it. Couldn't tell you what it is. Probably earns more than I do.
1662 | 255 | 254 | Haven't got a clue. But I wouldn't count on seeing it again.
1663 | 263 | 262 | It's anyone's guess. I expect it 's a deeply unpleasant experience involving hitherto unknown forms of pain and suffering.
1664 | 1287 | 1286 | I would take it but I don't think I know where to go. Not even sure I can go. Stuck really aren't I.
1665 | 271 | 270 | You're joking I presume, we're stuck fast on this hovel you call a planet. I could be wrong though it has been known to happen... I think.
1666 | 279 | 278 | Titanic. Titanic. No, I'm afraid the word means nothing to me. Still, what do I know. Not very much to be honest. I suppose that's why I'm here with you. It's sunk to this.
1667 | 287 | 286 | Whatever it is I'm sure you don't need it and you probably wouldn't get one anyway. So I wouldn't bother.
1668 | 295 | 294 | We're all unhappy and we all know it's going to get worse.
1669 | 967 | 966 | Who knows, who cares, who lives, who dies... Every door that opens offers yet another twist of fate.
1670 | 975 | 974 | Why not just fall off - finish the whole thing while you're ahead. I'm forgetting. You're probably not allowed to.
1671 | 983 | 982 | The elevators appear to go down. I don't know where they end up but down doesn't sound to me like a promising direction.
1672 | 999 | 998 | Never heard of her. Probably just a ship's follower, given what some of this crew are like.
1673 | 991 | 990 | No idea. A very large stow-away I expect.
1674 | 1277 | 1276 | It's a lottery. Or is it? I think I'll go and lie down. I'm not happy.
1675 | 303 | 302 | Never heard of it. I'm sure if it exists it will be eminently forgettable.
1676 | 311 | 310 | Who knows? Who cares?
1677 | 319 | 318 | No. It's gone. Had it for a second. Lost it . Not much chance I'll ever remember now.
1678 | 493 | 492 | Never heard of him. Sounds suspiciously Galloid to me.
1679 | 485 | 484 | Never heard of him. Sounds awfully Blarghish to me.
1680 | 1359 | 1358 | Haven't got a clue but I'll tell you something - whatever's happened to him I'll probably take the blame for it.
1681 | 477 | 476 | Never heard of him. Sounds awful whoever he is.
1682 | 469 | 468 | Never heard of her. Doubtless she'll contribute to this mess whoever she is.
1683 | 1343 | 1342 | I wonder if it always does that. It's probably suffered a complete mental breakdown. I won't be far behind it at this rate.
1684 | 1403 | 1402 | I think you'd better ask the BarBot about that.
1685 | 1395 | 1394 | I think you'd better ask the BellBot about that.
1686 | 1411 | 1410 | I think you'd better ask the DeskBot about that.
1687 | 5 | 4 | It's a foul-tasting witches' brew which when smothered over food utterly ruins it.
1688 | 13 | 12 | Yes I noticed when we left port. They breed like gibbets you know - it's going to get very messy.
1689 | 1259 | 1258 | Things are bad, but not that bad. There's no bomb on board.
1690 | 1293 | 1292 | It's probably turbulence - just my luck if we're in for a spot of stormy weather.
1691 | 21 | 20 | Each room has a unique identifier. We shall probably get them all confused and end up lost in space.
1692 | 29 | 28 | The restaurants are stuffed with chickens but I doubt you'll find anyone to serve you.
1693 | 37 | 36 | You'll need to change the chicken speed...
1694 | 45 | 44 | You'll need something to wipe the chicken. Sadly until you have the nous to get yourself upgraded you will find a suitable artifact hard to come by.
1695 | 53 | 52 | Pop up to Titania's Chamber. On second thoughts, given your track record I doubt you'll manage it.
1696 | 61 | 60 | Send it to the Parrot Room. We'll be lucky if it does any good though.
1697 | 709 | 708 | This is but one of my diverse responsibilities and the way things are going it will probably be my last.
1698 | 717 | 716 | I don't care where we go or what we do. All I know is that life isn't what it used to be.
1699 | 725 | 724 | The only time you'll find me down here is when there's a problem like you to deal with.
1700 | 733 | 732 | Very beautiful. Until you remember we should be a million light years from here.
1701 | 741 | 740 | We're going to check you in at which point I shall be at your beck and call for ever.
1702 | 749 | 748 | Press that button and I suspect our dismal journey recommences.
1703 | 757 | 756 | That is the DeskBot. Prepare to feel well gloomed.
1704 | 765 | 764 | You won't be needing the embarkation doors till we land. That is if we don't crash first.
1705 | 773 | 772 | Tradesman's entrance and yours truly has the dubious honor of using it daily.
1706 | 73 | 72 | There's chicken, chicken and chicken and I'm afraid that's considered choice enough for most.
1707 | 415 | 414 | Sir, Madam or other. What wearisome task can I perform for you now?
1708 | 433 | 432 | Sir, Madam or other. You called. I came. To be honest, I don't have much choice.
1709 | 417 | 416 | Sir, Madam or other. Here I am again. Why do I bother?
1710 | 419 | 418 | Sir, Madam or other. DoorBot here, ready for another fool's errand.
1711 | 421 | 420 | Sir, Madam or other. Fentible here. The reluctant DoorBot.
1712 | 423 | 422 | Sir, Madam or other. Your wish is my command. Unfortunately.
1713 | 425 | 424 | Sir, Madam or other. I'll do what you want but it's not going to change anything.
1714 | 427 | 426 | Sir, Madam or other. I don't know why I bother turning up - things aren't going to get better.
1715 | 429 | 428 | Sir, Madam or other. Yes, hello. Another day another meaningless task.
1716 | 431 | 430 | Sir, Madam or other. DoorBot here - programmed to help, for what it's worth.
1717 | 459 | 458 | I wouldn't trust myself to answer I'm afraid. You could try the BellBot - if it's worth it.
1718 | 1387 | 1386 | This isn't a game: we're flying headlong to disaster or my name's not Fentible.
1719 | 81 | 80 | Not entirely with you there - we probably lost a little something in the old translation. Reminds me of the day we had that explosion in the language bottling plant. Never did clear up the mess. Split infinitives everywhere.
1720 | 1005 | 1004 | If only we could go back. How often we try and find only unhappiness.
1721 | 1013 | 1012 | No time to hang around. Unless we get aboard now we'll be doomed to unhappiness for the rest of our lives.
1722 | 1021 | 1020 | That is the Personal Electronic Thing. Yet another useless gizmo.
1723 | 1029 | 1028 | Compared to the old Klepton lobe invader it is rather primitive. It's probably damaging your health even as we speak. Probably damaged mine already.
1724 | 1037 | 1036 | It's a Personal Electronic Thing. Won't work of course so I wouldn't bother getting excited.
1725 | 1045 | 1044 | Ship's rules. So they know where to send the body I suppose.
1726 | 1053 | 1052 | Yes, what a mess. We so nearly missed you too.
1727 | 1061 | 1060 | Due to an unfortunate navigational error the cruise liner Starship Titanic appears to have crashed into your lovely home. Such is my experience of these matters that I expect the mantle of blame will be placed upon my shoulders.
1728 | 1379 | 1378 | You've hit the gizzup on the head there. The whole ship's leaderless, rudderless, and out of control.
1729 | 89 | 88 | No hope whatsoever. By now they'll have set the starlings going.
1730 | 1335 | 1334 | It's your choice. Stay or go it will end in disaster. It always does. I think.
1731 | 101 | 100 | These parrots can't answer questions, which is a shame because it could probably get us out of this mess.
1732 | 109 | 108 | He only leaves that cage when he chooses. I recommend giving up all hope now.
1733 | 117 | 116 | Chicken and pistachios is all he's been calling for. He'll probably change his mind.
1734 | 133 | 132 | Chickens and nuts is what he wants. You'll have no joy finding them - not with the ship in this state.
1735 | 141 | 140 | The foul creature is continually hungry and the task of feeding it appears to have fallen to me.
1736 | 149 | 148 | I'll try but I think it's talking complete nonsense.
1737 | 165 | 164 | I feel the same way myself, never succeeded though.
1738 | 173 | 172 | He's a stubborn bird. And sadly I doubt you have the capacity to outwit it.
1739 | 181 | 180 | Throw the little beggar into the Succ-U-Bus and send it off. Good luck - he'll probably just fly back again straight away.
1740 | 189 | 188 | It's been on board since the ship was under construction. Funny thing really, everything was alright until the parrot arrived.
1741 | 1309 | 1308 | Getting the parrot to do something you want is about as easy as getting a new wig on Talapandee.
1742 | 1311 | 1310 | Getting the parrot to do something you want is about as easy as swallowing your own foot.
1743 | 781 | 780 | I think the parrot needs the feathers more than you. Although what use is the parrot. All it does is drive me mad.
1744 | 125 | 124 | Most parrots will eat anything but this one's a mangy beggar so I'd start with wood and only offer it the roast Zenuvian partridge when you think it's really earned it.
1745 | 157 | 156 | It knows a lot of what's been going on but as it's a parrot I doubt you'll learn very much.
1746 | 789 | 788 | That's Titania's nose. No wonder we're in a mess. It's chaos. That's what it is - chaos.
1747 | 797 | 796 | Try and get it back on Titania's face, although I doubt that this is going to be the end of our troubles.
1748 | 805 | 804 | Looks rather important to me. However, if the parrot's had it it's probably useless by now.
1749 | 813 | 812 | In my experience the successful traveler is prepared for any eventuality: although quite how an old parrot's perch will help you defeats me.
1750 | 821 | 820 | I believe that's part of the parrot's perch. I can think of no earthly reason why you should want to carry it round the ship.
1751 | 829 | 828 | I do believe that is the sound of a parrot in pain. Just our luck if he's stuck - he'll scream like that till the universe freezes over.
1752 | 837 | 836 | Just hang around - he's not a creature that likes to stay out late.
1753 | 845 | 844 | The parrot went wherever you addressed it - in theory.
1754 | 853 | 852 | The state we're in you might as well wring its neck and wear it as a hat for all the good it will do.
1755 | 861 | 860 | Just the usual rubbish but what can you expect?
1756 | 869 | 868 | It's just trying to confuse you with references to Titania.
1757 | 197 | 196 | They have pistachios in Second Class but I doubt whether you qualify for an upgrade.
1758 | 1301 | 1300 | He'll eat it all right. Then he'll want more. And then he'll just sulk and moan and generally ruin our lives.
1759 | 205 | 204 | Try the riff-raff restaurant. Do you know I have a dreadful feeling I shall have to do all your thinking for you.
1760 | 213 | 212 | I seem to remember seeing a spare glass somewhere in the bar - is it worth all the effort I ask myself.
1761 | 221 | 220 | I believe you can but quite what you're going to do with it once it's there is beyond me.
1762 | 1349 | 1348 | I expect I'd pop out somewhere else in the ship. Minus my dignity and what little pride remains.
1763 | 333 | 332 | Given the state of D'Astragaar there I don't think you're going to be getting much to eat.
1764 | 365 | 364 | It's a circuit connector I believe. But you don't stand a chance of finding where it comes from.
1765 | 325 | 324 | There's been murder committed all right. Given the state of the ship I doubt we'll catch the culprits.
1766 | 349 | 348 | Dead and there's not many comeback from there for breakfast I can tell you.
1767 | 357 | 356 | I've an awful feeling that dear Mr. Leovinus may have got a teeny bit worked up and done something he shouldn't have.
1768 | 341 | 340 | That's Scraliontis the Starship Titanic Project Accountant. Obviously didn't leave a big enough tip.
1769 | 229 | 228 | As you wish. I knew I'd be treated like this.
1770 | 237 | 236 | Oh yes there's no getting away from me is there. And there's no getting away from you either.
1771 | 877 | 876 | That'll be Doreen McLevity. Rather a low-life sort of person - not the subject of polite conversation.
1772 | 887 | 886 | Nothing happens. It's just a picture to amuse yourself with. Part of the entertainment structure for riff-raff class. On. Off. Smile. No smile. Sad isn't it.
1773 | 895 | 894 | As long as the PET code matches the room code you're home and dry - I don't think you'll be throwing many parties though.
1774 | 903 | 902 | Not exactly the Grand Palace of Hambra Gan I agree but what can you expect if you don't check the brochure beforehand.
1775 | 1365 | 1364 | Dead, and there's not many come back from there I can tell you.
1776 | 911 | 910 | More little luxuries. Curiously they only serve to remind me of the fragility of life and the danger of imminent hyper disaster which we should now be confronting.
1777 | 919 | 918 | Why should I care?
1778 | 939 | 938 | Dance around the room with them on your head I doubt it will do much good.
1779 | 245 | 244 | Oh that's the Succ-U-Bus. A hopeless and deeply unpleasant piece of equipment which is as likely to function properly as the people of Tolluck are to renounce lip-salve..
1780 | 253 | 252 | Usually the Succ-U-Bus is supposed to whizz your object wherever you want it to go. Today your guess will be as good as mine.
1781 | 261 | 260 | I expect I'd pop out somewhere else in the ship. Minus my dignity and what little pride remains.
1782 | 1285 | 1284 | Don't do taking, they wouldn't load me with the know-how. Said I wasn't suitable. Shame really. I think I would have been quite good at taking.
1783 | 269 | 268 | We've lost our slot now so even if we do go we'll just end up in a stack over Langua Centauri.
1784 | 277 | 276 | There has been and there can be no other vessel bearing the name Titanic: the word Titanic is wholly owned by the Pithy family of Zinnerman B and may only be uttered out of context under license. I wonder if we paid for the license. Probably not.
1785 | 285 | 284 | The only way I know is to catch the DeskBot in a good mood and that's about as likely as getting a drink out of a Scrimpoid.
1786 | 293 | 292 | Upgrades are possible, but I don't think you're suitable material.
1787 | 965 | 964 | All off-limits I'm afraid to Super Galactic Traveler class. And with the DeskBot in her current mood there's little chance of an upgrade.
1788 | 973 | 972 | Just take an elevator. Of course you'll have to endure the LiftBot but what is life if not a trial.
1789 | 981 | 980 | The elevators go down to the staterooms. Hardly worth showing you to your room though, what with this air of doom lingering over the whole ship like astral fog at a gloom party.
1790 | 997 | 996 | Titania was our great all-embracing mother intelligence. I say "was" because she no longer appears to be functioning.
1791 | 989 | 988 | That is Titania. Supposedly the central intelligence of the ship. These days she's doing the job about as effectively as a lemon on a nib boot.
1792 | 1373 | 1372 | Don't think it matters what we do with him. I expect it will turn out to be my fault anyway.
1793 | 301 | 300 | Just ask a BellBot - but you'll probably find some reason why you can't go there.
1794 | 309 | 308 | Given the time it's taking to solve our problems I doubt it matters where you go.
1795 | 317 | 316 | DoorBot 5987889317493763392 at your pleasure. Just a number and doomed I'm sure to remain one.
1796 | 491 | 490 | Temperamental over-paid jumped up waiter if you ask me. Works up in the first class restaurant. Goes to pieces at the first hint of trouble.
1797 | 483 | 482 | Rudest BarBot in the whole fleet - the very last sort of chap you need in a crisis.
1798 | 1357 | 1356 | That's the accountant. And no-one's going to tell me he died a natural death.
1799 | 475 | 474 | Tiresome fellow, lazy, rude, forgetful. Altogether a bit of a slacker and not the kind of BellBot that's going to help when the chips are down.
1800 | 467 | 466 | Nasty piece of work Marsinta. The mother of all DeskBots.
1801 | 1341 | 1340 | I've never seen it do that before. I suppose that means they're broken all over the ship.
1802 | 527 | 526 | Ah, the theater! The smell of the crowd, the taste of the greasepaint, the sound of the sea-urchins burbling down in the pit.
1803 | 529 | 528 | Oh yes - actresses. Of course in my day Doreen McLevity was the toast of all the Bots.
1804 | 531 | 530 | Oh you mean Idiot Purchase Prompts.
1805 | 585 | 584 | Ah a creative spirit is amongst us. I must show you some of my poetry. On second thoughts perhaps I'll just tidy up one or two rough edges first...
1806 | 623 | 622 | You know, you ought to visit the Sculpture Chamber - I think you're somebody who'd really appreciate it.
1807 | 1263 | 1262 | At the risk of repeating myself...
1808 | 549 | 548 | Afraid they've not crossed the threshold into galactic branding yet, have they.
1809 | 551 | 550 | Well what do I know - I can only just keep up with the shops in Blerontin.
1810 | 553 | 552 | I'm so out of touch you know. Modern life is so overwhelming.
1811 | 545 | 544 | I'm awfully flattered but I have to warn you I'm programmed to go into citizen's arrest mode should anyone try and interfere with me.
1812 | 547 | 546 | You had to be there, I'm sure.
1813 | 557 | 556 | Sadly these days food is something I can only talk about.
1814 | 559 | 558 | Good lord that means you still have crime - how delicious, how exciting.
1815 | 565 | 564 | Well, talking of crime there've been some pretty rum goings on in the old Titanic you know. You couldn't have come at a better time.
1816 | 567 | 566 | I'm sure the name should mean something to me but I am a little out of touch.
1817 | 1065 | 1064 | Nobody likes a smartass.
1818 | 1067 | 1066 | I do believe we've got our universes mixed up haven't we?
1819 | 1069 | 1068 | Very droll very droll. Let's think about the Starship Titanic instead though shall we?
1820 | 1071 | 1070 | Very clever, very clever. But in the end - unimpressive.
1821 | 1073 | 1072 | Fascinating. Astonishing. And yet meaningless.
1822 | 1075 | 1074 | I don't know what you're talking about. That's the official line and I'm sticking to it.
1823 | 1077 | 1076 | I know exactly what you mean. But let us not dwell on the past.
1824 | 1079 | 1078 | Interesting reference. Thought I wouldn't spot it didn't you? Well - Ha! - that's what I say to you.
1825 | 1081 | 1080 | You're testing me aren't you?
1826 | 1085 | 1084 | Good because I'm getting bored ransacking my memory board just to keep up with your cleverness...
1827 | 1083 | 1082 | Well I passed. Shall we get on with our lives now?
1828 | 569 | 568 | Talking of drinks, you really ought to visit the bar you know while you're here. Fortillian, our barman, mixes a devastating cocktail.
1829 | 571 | 570 | Not my cup of tea I'm afraid. Perhaps you should talk to Krage, the BellBot.
1830 | 555 | 554 | Your humble earth settlements mean nothing to me I'm afraid.
1831 | 575 | 574 | Interesting. You know before I got scanned I used to have a lot of those. It's all been narrowed down a bit recently.
1832 | 573 | 572 | Ah what is fame but an empty bubble, what is gold but a transient shining trouble...
1833 | 561 | 560 | Really? Well as you can see, I'm rather state of the art myself.
1834 | 533 | 532 | If you're an animal lover you'll really appreciate the menu in the first class restaurant. It's full of animals. They are dead of course, but that's just a technicality really.
1835 | 579 | 578 | Ah the bright lights, the lemony screen, what might have been...
1836 | 619 | 618 | Now if you're interested in wild life you mustn't leave the ship without visiting the Arboretum.
1837 | 577 | 576 | Talking of food, if you get yourself upgraded you'll be able to sample the extraordinary delights of the First Class Restaurant.
1838 | 581 | 580 | I used to play computer games you know, but they take up so much time don't they?
1839 | 589 | 588 | I know what you mean - bits of paper with writing on them. How delightfully primitive.
1840 | 605 | 604 | You know if you're interested in that sort of thing you ought to talk to the LiftBot. Nobby's his name, bit of an old soldier.
1841 | 593 | 592 | Now let me give you a little hint about chaps like that: round them up and put them somewhere safe for a year or two. You'll find you never really needed them at all.
1842 | 587 | 586 | You know I was always a great fan of Doreen McLevity but you probably wouldn't know of her.
1843 | 583 | 582 | Oh dear. Goes right over my head that sort of thing. Normally we'd have a PhilosoBot you could talk to but we seem to be rather undermanned.
1844 | 591 | 590 | Never heard of it I'm afraid but I'm new to this sector of the galaxy...
1845 | 599 | 598 | Science fiction. What a charmingly naive planet you do come from.
1846 | 601 | 600 | Such a sticky pastime - it astonishes me that so many species think so highly of it.
1847 | 603 | 602 | We picked up some of your soaps on our way through your atmosphere. Quite - how can I put it - enervating.
1848 | 607 | 606 | Tell you what, why not pop up to the music room later and play it for me.
1849 | 609 | 608 | How extraordinary to think that a primitive species such as your own could have embarked upon the great dark frontiers. How awfully clever of you.
1850 | 611 | 610 | I've said it once and I'll say it again - there's only one sport and that's Nib!
1851 | 613 | 612 | Whatever passes for sport on earth - put em up against a nib player and they'd be dead within seconds.
1852 | 615 | 614 | One mustn't mock of course, they're jolly useful chaps to have around.
1853 | 617 | 616 | Please treat your DoorBot courteously at all times: rude words can often offend.
1854 | 1313 | 1312 | Talapandee is a delightful holiday resort in the sensitively expanded Sunny region of Galantheon. Visitors to Talapandee may be assured of a charming and restful vacation all the year round. Unless they wear a wig. Holidaymakers wearing wigs in Talapandee are liable to be rounded up by the syrup squad, put up against a wall and summarily shot.
1855 | 595 | 594 | I've never been a great one for toys but I'm sure you'll enjoy the challenge of the chicken trap in the Super Galactic Traveler Restaurant.
1856 | 535 | 534 | How charming - you still have three dimensional transport.
1857 | 537 | 536 | How charming - you still have two dimensional transport.
1858 | 539 | 538 | Ah the golden age of travel - you invented the wheel so recently you must still really enjoy it.
1859 | 541 | 540 | I suppose at the speeds you normally travel you can see things out of the window.
1860 | 597 | 596 | TV presenters - what strange, sad folk they are. Of course they're extinct on so many planets now. Just weren't able to adapt.
1861 | 543 | 542 | You'll find that television is just a phase that all planets go through.
1862 | 621 | 620 | Ah well, if it's a blunt instrument you're after I can heartily recommend the chicken in the Super Galactic Traveler Restaurant.
1863 | 563 | 562 | How charming. You have your own little computer systems on earth do you. That must keep you awfully amused.
1864 | 1317 | 1316 | I can't tell you.
1865 | 1319 | 1318 | Because of the reason.
1866 | 1315 | 1314 | Because of the reason.
1867 | 881 | 880 | Yes I'm sure. Let's just change the subject shall we or better still why not go and look at another room.
1868 | 945 | 944 | I don't think that's going to help.
1869 | 949 | 948 | Sorry, can't remember.
1870 | 947 | 946 | Because of the reason.
1871 | 943 | 942 | Why on earth would you want to do that?
1872 | 955 | 954 | Who are you?
1873 | 957 | 956 | Where am I?
1874 | 959 | 958 | I'm no better so you'll just have to put up with me.
1875 | 1197 | 1196 | Don't suppose you know who I am do you. Ah well, I'm sure it'll come to me.
1876 | 1199 | 1198 | Sorry, can't help you. Total memory failure - give me a day or two, sure to come back.
1877 | 1177 | 1176 | Leave that one with me for a week or two would you?
1878 | 1201 | 1200 | Who am I? That's more important. Still, I'm sure someone will come along soon to collect me.
1879 | 1175 | 1174 | Oh dear another of those penetrating questions. I'm sure if you wait the answer will come to me. Umm..... ummmmmm no apparently not.
1880 | 1193 | 1192 | Who's flying the ship? Who did away with Brobostigon? Go for the big questions.
1881 | 1195 | 1194 | Who's been fiddling with the ship's controls? That's what I want to know.
1882 | 1169 | 1168 | What's that parrot on about? You know, he's more than the dumb creature I first took him for.
1883 | 1171 | 1170 | What can we do to get Fortillian out of his blessed loop? I'm sure you'll think of something.
1884 | 1173 | 1172 | What about chicken for dinner. I'm told the SGT restaurant has a quite singular menu.
1885 | 1167 | 1166 | What's the best way to get Titania working - that's what I want to know. Shouldn't take long I'm sure.
1886 | 1183 | 1182 | I wonder what's happened to my memory - or have I already asked you that?
1887 | 1211 | 1210 | I don't even know who I am any more. I'm a little teapot short and stout tip me up and.... uhh.... ummm..... oh.
1888 | 1191 | 1190 | Don't know. Don't care. Don't remember anything. What use is a robot with no memory? Might as well end it all now... can't remember how! ... Damn!
1889 | 1213 | 1212 | Don't know. Don't care. Stop bothering me.
1890 | 1215 | 1214 | Can't remember. Ask someone else. I'm sulking.
1891 | 1209 | 1208 | Who knows? Who cares? I don't.
1892 | 1189 | 1188 | Well I'm sure I will.
1893 | 1185 | 1184 | Oh. Sorry. Or have I already said that?
1894 | 1187 | 1186 | I wonder what's happened to my memory - or have I already asked you that?
1895 | 1179 | 1178 | What's the point of living? Not much if you ask me.
1896 | 1181 | 1180 | What's the best way to get off this ship? What's the most effective cure for sammhorroids? What's the reason for foot-odor? These are the questions that depress me.
1897 | 1205 | 1204 | I'm more interested in finding out who brought that damned parrot on board.
1898 | 1207 | 1206 | Don't know. And if I did it wouldn't do any good.
1899 | 1203 | 1202 | Who do I have to bribe to get me out of here - that's a rather more pertinent question.
1900 | 1151 | 1150 | Good question. When indeed. Don't ask me. Dodgy brain. Don't worry though - I'll be right as rain any minute.
1901 | 1153 | 1152 | When am I going to get my memory back? Did you ask that? No I did. I'll answer it: answer what..
1902 | 1155 | 1154 | When are the other passengers coming on board. I do love a busy ship.
1903 | 1147 | 1146 | When are we going to land anywhere? Soon I hope - there's quite a lot needs fixing round here.
1904 | 1149 | 1148 | When's Leovinus going to come along. I am looking forward to having one of our little chats.
1905 | 1161 | 1160 | Good question. When indeed. Don't ask me. Dodgy brain. And it's not getting any better.
1906 | 1163 | 1162 | When am I going to get my memory back? Did you ask that? No I did. I'll answer it: never, at this rate.
1907 | 1165 | 1164 | When are they going to bring on the dancing girls that's what I want to know. On second thoughts maybe we don't have any.
1908 | 1157 | 1156 | When is someone going to get this ship up and running again? At a guess, never.
1909 | 1159 | 1158 | When are you going to realize that you're not going to get anywhere until you've got an upgrade?
1910 | 1125 | 1124 | No use asking me. Not with my memory. Try later - who knows, I might have got better.
1911 | 1127 | 1126 | Not too hot on the old whereabouts type question I'm afraid. Memory seems to have popped out. Should be back later though.
1912 | 1129 | 1128 | Where's my memory gone, that's what I want to know. Perhaps if I just wait, it'll come home. I wonder if it will remember where to come to well if it doesn't it won't be worth having.
1913 | 1115 | 1114 | Where are you going to get the ingredients for the Titanic Titillator - that's a far more important question.
1914 | 1117 | 1116 | Where are you going to get an upgrade - that's a question that's worth thinking about.
1915 | 1119 | 1118 | Where did Scraliontis and Brobostigon hide everything? That's rather a jolly question.
1916 | 1121 | 1120 | Where did Brobostigon put Titania's eye? Still I'm sure you'll find it.
1917 | 1123 | 1122 | Where did Brobostigon's body end up? Can't have just disappeared.
1918 | 1141 | 1140 | No use asking me. Not with my memory. Doubt if I'll work again, not with a brain like this.
1919 | 1143 | 1142 | Not too hot on the old whereabouts type question I'm afraid. Memory seems to have popped out. Not coming back from the look of it.
1920 | 1145 | 1144 | Where's my memory gone, that's what I want to know. I doubt you'll be able to help.
1921 | 1131 | 1130 | Where are you going to acquire the skills necessary to remove us from this predicament. That's what bothers me.
1922 | 1133 | 1132 | Where did they put Nobby's head? I suppose we'll never know.
1923 | 1135 | 1134 | Where is Fortillian going to find starling puree. He's doomed if he doesn't you know.
1924 | 1137 | 1136 | Where did they get that parrot? Damned bird drives me mad.
1925 | 1139 | 1138 | Where did Brobostigon put Titania's mouth. I suppose we'll never know.
1926 | 1229 | 1228 | Don't know I'm afraid.
1927 | 1231 | 1230 | Why did the chicken cross... dammit what did the chicken do?
1928 | 1233 | 1232 | Mmm. Well, they're a law unto themselves, chickens.
1929 | 1235 | 1234 | Why did it do that?
1930 | 1237 | 1236 | Well, I think that's enough about chickens.
1931 | 1239 | 1238 | Extraordinary. What logical creatures they are.
1932 | 1241 | 1240 | Couldn't tell you. You probably don't need to know anyway.
1933 | 1217 | 1216 | Why indeed. I'm sure the answer's obvious and you'll find it. Try asking Krage.
1934 | 1219 | 1218 | Asking why implies there's some logical answer. Not in this case, I'm afraid.
1935 | 1221 | 1220 | Why doesn't someone change my settings? It would only take a minute.
1936 | 1223 | 1222 | Easy. Just pop up to the Sculpture Chamber and pull the lever.
1937 | 1225 | 1224 | Why doesn't Leovinus do something? I'm sure he'll get us out of this mess.
1938 | 1227 | 1226 | That's a tough one - I'm afraid I just don't know the answer.
1939 | 1249 | 1248 | Don't know why. Don't know anything anymore.
1940 | 1251 | 1250 | Why doesn't my memory work? That's what I want to know. I think...
1941 | 1253 | 1252 | Why have all the other chaps gone loopy. It's all going to end in tears you know.
1942 | 1243 | 1242 | What do I care? We're all doomed anyway.
1943 | 1245 | 1244 | Why did it have to be you when the universe is full of useful beings.
1944 | 1247 | 1246 | Why didn't I take that job as a holiday courier..
1945 | 627 | 626 | Haven't got a clue. Why not take it for a spin.
1946 | 635 | 634 | I've never been to this dreadful place in my life. I wouldn't trouble yourself with it - I'm sure that in a million light years we shall have no need of return.
1947 | 675 | 674 | There's a word for his condition but it momentarily escapes me. He'll be right as rain any moment I'm sure.
1948 | 683 | 682 | Well I've no idea. Perhaps he was looking for butterflies and tripped?
1949 | 691 | 690 | Can't quite remember the old emergency drill today. Let's just ignore him - he'll probably go away.
1950 | 643 | 642 | Good Lord there's something in the pipe. Don't you worry though, somebody will look into that shortly. I wonder who?
1951 | 651 | 650 | Heaven only knows. We could always wait 'til it re-incarnates as a spider.
1952 | 667 | 666 | Could be the King of Kalpon for all I know. He'll wake up in a second and tell us.
1953 | 659 | 658 | I wonder if it always does that. I thought it was rather fun actually.
1954 | 699 | 698 | Heaven knows where we are but I'm sure it's not anywhere you want to be.
1955 | 625 | 624 | Just plug it in and the Succ-U-Bus will send you any where in the ship you want to go: what a joyously modern thing the old Titanic is eh?
1956 | 633 | 632 | This is perhaps the least important room on board. I wouldn't trouble yourself with it.
1957 | 673 | 672 | Dead I believe but I'm sure it's not as serious as it looks.
1958 | 681 | 680 | I know he had a slight difference of opinion with Leovinus - perhaps he took the honorable way out?
1959 | 689 | 688 | I think we'd better just leave him here. Who knows - he might feel better after a bit of peace and quiet.
1960 | 641 | 640 | Funny you should mention that. The Succ-U-Bus keeps complaining about it. Probably just a bit of food eh? Couldn't possibly be a body.
1961 | 649 | 648 | We'll call a plumb-bot and it'll be fixed in a jiffy.
1962 | 665 | 664 | That's Brobostigon. But don't you worry, I'm sure he's just playing about.
1963 | 657 | 656 | I've never seen it do that before. I'm sure someone will rectify the Succ-U-Bus immediately.
1964 | 697 | 696 | This is the bilge room and you really don't want to be here.
1965 | 631 | 630 | Haven't got a clue. I don't expect it works what ever it is.
1966 | 639 | 638 | I've never been to this dreadful place in my life. Doubtless knowing my luck I shall be visiting it again shortly.
1967 | 679 | 678 | There's a word for his condition but it momentarily escapes me.
1968 | 687 | 686 | I've no idea. I expect he was done away with and we're probably next in the queue.
1969 | 695 | 694 | Can't remember how many lives people have: he doesn't look as though he deserved more than the one.
1970 | 647 | 646 | Good Lord there's something in the pipe. It's probably my life support system. Or my pay. How do we get it out?
1971 | 655 | 654 | We probably have to get someone special in. Can't remember who though.
1972 | 671 | 670 | Haven't got a clue but I'll tell you something - whatever's happened to him I'll probably take the blame for it.
1973 | 663 | 662 | I wonder if it always does that. It's probably suffered a complete mental breakdown. I won't be far behind it at this rate.
1974 | 703 | 702 | Heaven knows where we are. but you certainly don't want to be here.. I certainly don't so far as I can be certain about anything.
1975 | 629 | 628 | Just plug it in and the Succ-U-Bus will send you any where in the ship you want to go: as if that's going to get us out of this mess.
1976 | 637 | 636 | This is perhaps the least important room on board. Doubtless knowing my luck I shall be visiting it again shortly.
1977 | 677 | 676 | Dead and there's not many comeback from there I can tell you.
1978 | 685 | 684 | He wasn't exactly mister popular. I expect someone had him mislaid.
1979 | 693 | 692 | Don't think it matters what we do with him. I expect it will turn out to be my fault anyway.
1980 | 645 | 644 | Funny you should mention that. The Succ-U-Bus keeps complaining about it. It's probably my life support system. Or my pay.
1981 | 653 | 652 | Call a plumb-bot. Not that it'll do much good. I've not seen one since we launched.
1982 | 669 | 668 | That's Brobostigon. And no-one's going to tell me he died a natural death.
1983 | 661 | 660 | I've never seen it do that before. I suppose that means they're broken all over the ship.
1984 | 701 | 700 | This is the bilge room and you really don't want to be here and neither do I.</doorbot>

15 | 1867 | 1866 | Behind you!
16 | 1871 | 1870 | Behind you?
17 | 1083 | 1082 | Good.
18 | 1119 | 1118 | Terrific.
19 | 1123 | 1122 | Wholly predictable.
20 | 1127 | 1126 | I like that.
21 | 1131 | 1130 | Interesting.
22 | 1135 | 1134 | Intelligent response - for a sub-species.
23 | 1139 | 1138 | Mmm.
24 | 1143 | 1142 | Astounding.
25 | 1147 | 1146 | Mmm. Deeply uninteresting.
26 | 1149 | 1148 | I'm sorry, you're boring me.
27 | 1087 | 1086 | OK.
28 | 1153 | 1152 | I've had enough of this.
29 | 1157 | 1156 | You'll forgive me if I don't want to listen to you any more.
30 | 1161 | 1160 | Gosh you are dull.
31 | 1165 | 1164 | A word of wisdom: A higher standard of discourse is necessary to sustain my interest.
32 | 1167 | 1166 | I am sooooo bored!
33 | 1169 | 1168 | Lord I'm tired of this drivel.
34 | 1091 | 1090 | Yes indeed.
35 | 1095 | 1094 | That's fine.
36 | 1099 | 1098 | That's OK.
37 | 1103 | 1102 | All right, all right.
38 | 1107 | 1106 | Staggering.
39 | 1111 | 1110 | Outlandish.
40 | 1115 | 1114 | Perfect.
41 | 2067 | 2066 | But of course.
42 | 671 | 670 | My dear child, trying to catch me out with odd words will NOT get you that upgrade.
43 | 673 | 672 | I've said it before and I'll say it again. I have nothing more to say about Byzantine Numismatists.
44 | 1661 | 1660 | If I could do you think I'd be sitting here talking to you?
45 | 925 | 924 | I can't possibly tell you that.
46 | 929 | 928 | You've a real nerve asking a decent DeskBot a personal question like that. You'll get no help out of me today.
47 | 2219 | 2218 | Carry on.
48 | 2223 | 2222 | Continue.
49 | 2227 | 2226 | Tell me more.
50 | 2207 | 2206 | Charming.
51 | 2083 | 2082 | Company policy.
52 | 2339 | 2338 | Marsinta.
53 | 2375 | 2374 | Yes.
54 | 2635 | 2634 | Typical.
55 | 2639 | 2638 | It's never too late.
56 | 2643 | 2642 | I'm not a taxi.
57 | 2647 | 2646 | Many times.
58 | 2651 | 2650 | Not much recently.
59 | 2379 | 2378 | No.
60 | 2383 | 2382 | Well, maybe.
61 | 2387 | 2386 | Why?
62 | 2391 | 2390 | What for?
63 | 2395 | 2394 | Yes, I do too.
64 | 2399 | 2398 | Do you?
65 | 2403 | 2402 | That's good.
66 | 2407 | 2406 | Never heard of him.
67 | 2411 | 2410 | Never heard of her.
68 | 2343 | 2342 | I do.
69 | 2415 | 2414 | Never heard of them.
70 | 2419 | 2418 | What's one of those.
71 | 2423 | 2422 | You're awfully chatty.
72 | 2427 | 2426 | You're not saying much. Not that I'm complaining.
73 | 2431 | 2430 | That's right.
74 | 2435 | 2434 | Me too.
75 | 2439 | 2438 | All the time.
76 | 2443 | 2442 | Whatever you say.
77 | 2447 | 2446 | Not sure.
78 | 2451 | 2450 | Do what?
79 | 2347 | 2346 | I would.
80 | 2455 | 2454 | Not today thanks.
81 | 2459 | 2458 | I've no idea.
82 | 2463 | 2462 | It is.
83 | 2467 | 2466 | They do.
84 | 2471 | 2470 | They are.
85 | 2475 | 2474 | Could be.
86 | 2479 | 2478 | Sure is.
87 | 2483 | 2482 | What's the point in that?
88 | 2487 | 2486 | Oh, I see.
89 | 2491 | 2490 | Oh, I don't know.
90 | 2351 | 2350 | I wouldn't.
91 | 2495 | 2494 | Love it.
92 | 2499 | 2498 | Not so sure about that.
93 | 2503 | 2502 | I never was a great fan.
94 | 2507 | 2506 | They have.
95 | 2511 | 2510 | A little.
96 | 2515 | 2514 | I know.
97 | 2519 | 2518 | I should think not.
98 | 2523 | 2522 | Many times.
99 | 2527 | 2526 | Never again.
100 | 2531 | 2530 | I might.
101 | 2355 | 2354 | Really?
102 | 2535 | 2534 | It might.
103 | 2539 | 2538 | No can do.
104 | 2543 | 2542 | Well, I'm not.
105 | 2547 | 2546 | That's good.
106 | 2551 | 2550 | A hunch.
107 | 2239 | 2238 | I am.
108 | 2243 | 2242 | You're not.
109 | 2247 | 2246 | You are.
110 | 2251 | 2250 | You will.
111 | 2359 | 2358 | Would you?
112 | 2255 | 2254 | Oh.
113 | 2259 | 2258 | Oh dear.
114 | 2263 | 2262 | Me too.
115 | 2267 | 2266 | Please?
116 | 2271 | 2270 | Yeah, right.
117 | 2279 | 2278 | Isn't she?
118 | 2283 | 2282 | Isn't he?
119 | 2287 | 2286 | Aren't they?
120 | 2291 | 2290 | Won't they?
121 | 2295 | 2294 | Won't she?
122 | 2363 | 2362 | Do you?
123 | 2299 | 2298 | Won't he?
124 | 2303 | 2302 | Does he?
125 | 2307 | 2306 | Does she?
126 | 2311 | 2310 | Do they?
127 | 2315 | 2314 | Go on.
128 | 2319 | 2318 | Is that so?
129 | 2323 | 2322 | Is that right?
130 | 2327 | 2326 | My goodness.
131 | 2331 | 2330 | Uh oh.
132 | 2335 | 2334 | I see.
133 | 2367 | 2366 | Will you?
134 | 2555 | 2554 | No problem.
135 | 2559 | 2558 | That's right.
136 | 2563 | 2562 | Of course.
137 | 2567 | 2566 | Could be.
138 | 2571 | 2570 | Who?
139 | 2575 | 2574 | What?
140 | 2579 | 2578 | Where?
141 | 2583 | 2582 | Why?
142 | 2587 | 2586 | When?
143 | 2591 | 2590 | Is he?
144 | 2371 | 2370 | Are you sure?
145 | 2595 | 2594 | Is she?
146 | 2599 | 2598 | Are they?
147 | 2603 | 2602 | Will he?
148 | 2607 | 2606 | Will she?
149 | 2611 | 2610 | Will they?
150 | 2615 | 2614 | Did he?
151 | 2619 | 2618 | Did she?
152 | 2623 | 2622 | Did they?
153 | 2627 | 2626 | Just like you.
154 | 2631 | 2630 | Just like me.
155 | 2195 | 2194 | Delightful.
156 | 1483 | 1482 | Do you have a reservation?
157 | 1485 | 1484 | Wrong! Now let me ask you again, do you have a reservation?
158 | 957 | 956 | Well you've got me there. I'm afraid I just don't know.
159 | 1759 | 1758 | Don't you start.
160 | 2167 | 2166 | Everyday.
161 | 2027 | 2026 | Exactly.
162 | 2039 | 2038 | I expect not.
163 | 2035 | 2034 | I expect so.
164 | 1899 | 1898 | Fantastic!
165 | 715 | 714 | That's absolutely fine by me - I care very little what you do just as long as it doesn't create an unpleasant odor or disturb the other passengers.
166 | 717 | 716 | News of your embarkation sure did travel fast didn't it.
167 | 2163 | 2162 | First week of the month.
168 | 965 | 964 | Yes. I do believe SGT Class suits you. That distinctive lack of manners.
169 | 969 | 968 | What a rude, rude biped you are.
170 | 973 | 972 | Just because I'm a Bot there's no reason to treat me like one.
171 | 875 | 874 | Would you mind just going away and asking somebody else? I'm really very tired of you.
172 | 877 | 876 | Who cares?
173 | 879 | 878 | Good. Why don't you find a nice little hole somewhere and go and do your caring in it.
174 | 881 | 880 | Know what I think? I think you should give me a little more respect.
175 | 883 | 882 | If you really respected me - YOU'D LEAVE ME IN PEACE!!
176 | 885 | 884 | I can't tell you that.
177 | 889 | 888 | Because of the Reason.
178 | 1775 | 1774 | Why don't you go to the bar?
179 | 1787 | 1786 | Why don't you go to the bilge room?
180 | 1779 | 1778 | Why don't you go to the first class restaurant?
181 | 1783 | 1782 | Why don't you go to the music room?
182 | 1791 | 1790 | Why don't you go to the Parrot's lobby?
183 | 1795 | 1794 | Why don't you go to the Super Galactic Traveler Class Restaurant?
184 | 1619 | 1618 | Goodbye.
185 | 1503 | 1502 | I've got better things to do than sit here chatting.
186 | 1505 | 1504 | Yes, you do, don't you.
187 | 1507 | 1506 | I've nothing more to say.
188 | 1509 | 1508 | Run along with you, I've got a job to do.
189 | 1511 | 1510 | Talk to some of the other Bots who've got less important things to do than me!
190 | 1513 | 1512 | I'm busy! Gimme me a break.
191 | 1515 | 1514 | Help? Help? Help? Help yourself, why don't you?
192 | 1517 | 1516 | You want some help? Why don't you go and find out what's been going on around here!
193 | 2203 | 2202 | Great.
194 | 1743 | 1742 | Ha ha ha.
195 | 2023 | 2022 | That happens all the time.
196 | 651 | 650 | Oh this cruel, cruel world that has things you do not like within it.
197 | 655 | 654 | Is there anything I can do that might help?
198 | 633 | 632 | I wish I could do something. Unfortunately I'm waiting for a first class passenger to come along so I can help them.
199 | 635 | 634 | You know if you want an upgrade you're going to have to be a little more discreet about your likes and dislikes.
200 | 639 | 638 | I sympathize completely and will endeavor to do very little about it.
201 | 641 | 640 | I'm sorry to hear that. Next question.
202 | 643 | 642 | How dreadfully banal for you.
203 | 645 | 644 | Well, the universe wasn't created just for your pleasure. I know this for a fact because there are not foul, greasy burger bars on every corner.
204 | 627 | 626 | My, aren't we amusing when we have a head of steam up. I've never known a 3rd class passenger with the gall to express such likes and dislikes.
205 | 629 | 628 | How awful for you. As if I should care.
206 | 631 | 630 | Like, hate, aren't we just a maelstrom of emotions.
207 | 1635 | 1634 | You've wangled your way up to first class already. That's it.
208 | 2109 | 2108 | Have a nice day.
209 | 1019 | 1018 | And how are we today dear passenger?
210 | 1023 | 1022 | Yes well, you're obviously confusing me with a DeskBot who gives a damn.
211 | 1025 | 1024 | Greetings biped!
212 | 1047 | 1046 | How are you?
213 | 1055 | 1054 | Nice weather we're having.
214 | 573 | 572 | Fentible was telling me there's a body up in the First Class Restaurant. Not that it's any business of mine of course.
215 | 599 | 598 | If I were you I'd pay a visit to the Music Room.
216 | 601 | 600 | My word Marsinta you are being helpful today.
217 | 605 | 604 | If you aren't satisfied with the Super Galactic Traveler room perhaps you should read the in-flight magazine to take your mind off it.
218 | 607 | 606 | If you really want to be helpful perhaps you could work out why the cyberintelligence appears to be out of control.
219 | 609 | 608 | Might I suggest a detailed examination of Titania's Chamber - after all, that's where the controls are.
220 | 613 | 612 | Perhaps you should watch a little more TV. Last time I looked there was something very odd going on in one of the first class staterooms.
221 | 615 | 614 | I'm no scandal monger but did you hear there's a body in the First Class Restaurant? Krage was telling me the service has gone completely to pieces.
222 | 617 | 616 | I did hear there's a body in the Bilge Room. But then I suppose there's always a body in the Bilge Room.
223 | 619 | 618 | Search the bodies, that's what I'd do if I wasn't stuck behind this damn desk.
224 | 621 | 620 | If I were you I'd defuse the bomb before it goes off.
225 | 575 | 574 | Fentible was telling me there's a body down in the bilge room. Not that I make it a habit to listen to tittle tattle of course.
226 | 625 | 624 | You have to be pretty clever to defuse a bomb like that you know.
227 | 577 | 576 | I believe you require a crushed television? Have you tried asking the BellBot?
228 | 579 | 578 | You should visit the Arboretum - I believe one can change the weather up there.
229 | 581 | 580 | I believe you require lemons. The Arboretum would be a good place to start looking.
230 | 585 | 584 | I hear they have lemon trees in the Arboretum you know.
231 | 587 | 586 | Might I suggest you visit the Bar and see if you can help the BarBot with his Titanic Titillator.
232 | 589 | 588 | A simple method of crushing a TV would be to get the BellBot to throw one off the Top of the Well.
233 | 593 | 592 | They have starlings up on the Promenade Deck you know. I'm sure you of all people will find a way of squashing them.
234 | 595 | 594 | I've always suspected that the drains on the Promenade Deck lead down into the Super Galactic Traveler food system. Perhaps that's where you might find the starling pur$e?
235 | 597 | 596 | If you're not satisfied with the way I'm treating you, you're quite at liberty to go to the Sculpture Chamber and change my settings.
236 | 1631 | 1630 | You get upgrades from me, and I don't give 'em.
237 | 1593 | 1592 | As well as I need to be thank you.
238 | 1051 | 1050 | I'm terrific.
239 | 1597 | 1596 | Oh, I'm just worried about what's happened to Titania.
240 | 1883 | 1882 | How come?
241 | 1569 | 1568 | Ask the BellBot!
242 | 1541 | 1540 | Does the phrase 'distributed intelligence' mean anything to you, because that's what I think we've got here. I could go on.
243 | 1543 | 1542 | Damn fool system design. Each of her primary functions was localized in just one lobe. Take those lobes away and the whole thing is disabled. Stupid! I could go on!
244 | 1545 | 1544 | Well, that's what I think they did. You want to know who I mean? I could go on...
245 | 1547 | 1546 | Scraliontis and Brobostigon, that's who! I think they took her brain apart! I could go on!
246 | 1549 | 1548 | It's a pity you don't have any brains yourself or you might be able to find what happened to all the bits! I could say more!
247 | 1551 | 1550 | But I won't...
248 | 1915 | 1914 | How much?
249 | 1647 | 1646 | You think this is just a game do you?
250 | 1565 | 1564 | Get in them. Use them.
251 | 1903 | 1902 | How did you know?
252 | 1979 | 1978 | How do you think?
253 | 2095 | 2094 | I agree.
254 | 1935 | 1934 | I'm amazing.
255 | 1939 | 1938 | I'm a bot.
256 | 1577 | 1576 | So go eat!
257 | 2235 | 2234 | I'm not.
258 | 2043 | 2042 | I'd be very surprised.
259 | 1747 | 1746 | I could.
260 | 1751 | 1750 | I could go on.
261 | 1753 | 1752 | I could say more.
262 | 1733 | 1732 | I did.
263 | 1737 | 1736 | I didn't.
264 | 1725 | 1724 | I do.
265 | 1729 | 1728 | I don't.
266 | 2007 | 2006 | I don't think so.
267 | 1843 | 1842 | I don't understand.
268 | 1847 | 1846 | I still don't understand.
269 | 1851 | 1850 | I'm really having a lot of difficulty understanding this.
270 | 1679 | 1678 | I know that.
271 | 1623 | 1622 | Let me correct you. the Parrot IS APPALLING.
272 | 2047 | 2046 | I wouldn't be at all surprised.
273 | 1705 | 1704 | Oh I see.
274 | 1839 | 1838 | I understand.
275 | 2183 | 2182 | Indeed.
276 | 1959 | 1958 | Interesting.
277 | 2087 | 2086 | It is.
278 | 2091 | 2090 | It isn't.
279 | 2075 | 2074 | Oh it's you again.
280 | 2015 | 2014 | Just because.
281 | 1655 | 1654 | They tell you what class you're in.
282 | 1895 | 1894 | Lovely!
283 | 1907 | 1906 | Many's the time.
284 | 2655 | 2654 | It's a marketing term.
285 | 1639 | 1638 | And human is a weird species.
286 | 845 | 844 | Maybe.
287 | 1615 | 1614 | Maybe.
288 | 849 | 848 | Maybe, maybe not.
289 | 853 | 852 | I wouldn't say no - but then again I wouldn't say yes.
290 | 857 | 856 | Possibly. And also possibly not.
291 | 861 | 860 | Could be.
292 | 865 | 864 | Perhaps. Then again, perhaps not.
293 | 869 | 868 | Good question. Allow me not to answer it.
294 | 871 | 870 | Good question. Let's not spoil it with an answer.
295 | 873 | 872 | To be honest, I don't really care.
296 | 2113 | 2112 | Missing you already.
297 | 2191 | 2190 | Neat.
298 | 1963 | 1962 | Never.
299 | 897 | 896 | Never.
300 | 901 | 900 | All the time.
301 | 905 | 904 | Sometimes.
302 | 909 | 908 | Often.
303 | 913 | 912 | Occasionally.
304 | 917 | 916 | Hardly ever.
305 | 921 | 920 | When the mood's right.
306 | 931 | 930 | That'll be the day.
307 | 933 | 932 | From time to time.
308 | 2187 | 2186 | Nice.
309 | 1029 | 1028 | Possibly. Let's give it a little time.
310 | 1033 | 1032 | Jury's still out on that one.
311 | 1035 | 1034 | Good to meet you too.
312 | 1039 | 1038 | The pleasure's all yours. Ha.
313 | 1043 | 1042 | See how you feel when we get to Vastan.
314 | 1045 | 1044 | It's our destination blunderhead.
315 | 1695 | 1694 | No.
316 | 777 | 776 | No.
317 | 811 | 810 | No way.
318 | 813 | 812 | You have got to be kidding.
319 | 815 | 814 | Never.
320 | 817 | 816 | Ha! Over my dead body.
321 | 819 | 818 | Not a chance.
322 | 821 | 820 | Not a hope.
323 | 825 | 824 | Nope.
324 | 829 | 828 | Out of the question.
325 | 831 | 830 | Wrong.
326 | 833 | 832 | That is one of the stupidest questions I have ever heard.
327 | 781 | 780 | No no no no no no no!!!!
328 | 835 | 834 | All that expensive training - and I have to deal with sub-species like you. NO!
329 | 841 | 840 | The answer's no. You know something, I'm sure you were better suited to third class.
330 | 843 | 842 | No. Absolutely N O. I am beginning to regret ever having upgraded you.
331 | 1605 | 1604 | No.
332 | 2275 | 2274 | No way.
333 | 785 | 784 | No.
334 | 837 | 836 | Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. No.
335 | 789 | 788 | No.
336 | 793 | 792 | No.
337 | 797 | 796 | No.
338 | 801 | 800 | No.
339 | 805 | 804 | No.
340 | 1467 | 1466 | The BarBot is a mendacious, time-wasting fool.
341 | 2079 | 2078 | I'm afraid that's not company policy.
342 | 1761 | 1760 | I don't wish to speak about that.
343 | 2055 | 2054 | That's not what I heard.
344 | 1691 | 1690 | Of course.
345 | 1699 | 1698 | Of course not.
346 | 1709 | 1708 | Ok.
347 | 1481 | 1480 | Welcome guest number... er, one, to the Starship Titanic, the most glamorous galactic cruiseship experience in the whole of the space-time continuum, more fabulous than mortal tongue can say, stupendous, gorgeous, above all the ship that cannot possibly go wrong. Ha! I am the DeskBot. I am here to welcome you on board and allocate you to your overwhelmingly lovely stateroom. And who might you be?
348 | 937 | 936 | I'm sure you're right.
349 | 941 | 940 | That might be a good thing to do and then again it might not.
350 | 945 | 944 | Absolutely.
351 | 949 | 948 | Without a doubt.
352 | 1859 | 1858 | Over there!
353 | 1863 | 1862 | Over there?
354 | 2117 | 2116 | I don't wish to be rude - well in fact I do, so pig's bladder to you.
355 | 1887 | 1886 | It's a possibility.
356 | 1999 | 1998 | Possibly.
357 | 2003 | 2002 | Possibly not.
358 | 2031 | 2030 | Precisely.
359 | 1003 | 1002 | At the risk of repeating myself -
360 | 1007 | 1006 | I'll say it once and I'll say it again -
361 | 1011 | 1010 | If I've said it once I've said it a hundred times -
362 | 1015 | 1014 | Didn't you just say that didn't you just say that didn't you just say that - see what it's like?
363 | 1991 | 1990 | Probably.
364 | 1995 | 1994 | Probably not.
365 | 767 | 766 | Oh how sweet! You got another question right and you have such a tiny tiny brain!
366 | 771 | 770 | Extraordinary. I've detected no signs of intelligent life - and yet you got a question right.
367 | 1471 | 1470 | Do you have science on your planet? How terribly forward of you.
368 | 1475 | 1474 | Of course by your standards a Blerontin donut would probably qualify as a scientist.
369 | 1721 | 1720 | Really?
370 | 993 | 992 | You're repeating yourself dear.
371 | 997 | 996 | I do believe I heard that question the first time round.
372 | 999 | 998 | You know dear, repeating a stupid question does not increase its chances of being answered.
373 | 2199 | 2198 | Repugnant.
374 | 1875 | 1874 | Right here!
375 | 977 | 976 | Ah, good day. Marsinta here ready to do her best.
376 | 981 | 980 | Ahoy passenger! How can Marsinta help you today?.
377 | 985 | 984 | Yes, you can ring my bell any time.
378 | 989 | 988 | Yes? May I help you?
379 | 1947 | 1946 | You can say that again.
380 | 1075 | 1074 | Come on snap out of it!
381 | 1077 | 1076 | Look, I haven't got all day. Did you want something?
382 | 1079 | 1078 | Over here lard-head!
383 | 1081 | 1080 | I'm running out of patience. If you don't want to talk to me - fine!
384 | 661 | 660 | Well aren't we the clever one.
385 | 1967 | 1966 | Sometimes.
386 | 1487 | 1486 | Yes?
387 | 1489 | 1488 | You spaced?
388 | 1491 | 1490 | HELLO? HELLO?
389 | 1493 | 1492 | Did you fail to say something?
390 | 1249 | 1248 | but I'm not too sure.
391 | 1285 | 1284 | but I'm having a little trouble working out.
392 | 1253 | 1252 | but I'm not quite certain.
393 | 1257 | 1256 | but I can't quite absolutely recall.
394 | 1261 | 1260 | but I'm having a little trouble remembering.
395 | 1265 | 1264 | but it appears to have slipped my memory.
396 | 1269 | 1268 | but I'm not absolutely certain.
397 | 1273 | 1272 | but I can't say with absolute conviction.
398 | 1277 | 1276 | but I find it difficult to be sure.
399 | 1281 | 1280 | but I couldn't say with total certainty.
400 | 1211 | 1210 | , and I doubt you'll ever understand,
401 | 1245 | 1244 | , and I must say it's quite a rare event for me,
402 | 1215 | 1214 | , and I rather hope you'll take it personally,
403 | 1219 | 1218 | , and you certainly mustn't blame anyone for it,
404 | 1223 | 1222 | , and I'm quite prepared to take the blame myself for it,
405 | 1227 | 1226 | , and don't even think about blaming anyone,
406 | 1231 | 1230 | , and I'd appreciate it if you kept it to yourself,
407 | 1233 | 1232 | , and don't think it's got anything to do with you personally,
408 | 1237 | 1236 | , and I'd say this to any of the passengers,
409 | 1241 | 1240 | , and I must say it doesn't often happen to me,
410 | 1289 | 1288 | how.
411 | 1327 | 1326 | why you're going to do that.
412 | 1331 | 1330 | why you keep asking these dumbass questions.
413 | 1335 | 1334 | why you think that's relevant.
414 | 1339 | 1338 | why you persist in being such an idiot.
415 | 1343 | 1342 | why you insist on acting in such a stupid manner.
416 | 1347 | 1346 | why you continue to act so strangely.
417 | 1351 | 1350 | who.
418 | 1355 | 1354 | who you mean.
419 | 1359 | 1358 | who did it.
420 | 1363 | 1362 | who moved it.
421 | 1293 | 1292 | how it works.
422 | 1367 | 1366 | who took it.
423 | 1371 | 1370 | who hid it.
424 | 1375 | 1374 | where.
425 | 1379 | 1378 | where it is.
426 | 1383 | 1382 | where they are.
427 | 1387 | 1386 | where it went.
428 | 1391 | 1390 | where they went.
429 | 1395 | 1394 | where it could be.
430 | 1399 | 1398 | where they could be.
431 | 1403 | 1402 | where he is.
432 | 1297 | 1296 | how you might solve that.
433 | 1407 | 1406 | where she is.
434 | 1411 | 1410 | when.
435 | 1415 | 1414 | when we're going to arrive.
436 | 1419 | 1418 | when that happened.
437 | 1423 | 1422 | when - if at all.
438 | 1427 | 1426 | when that'll happen.
439 | 1431 | 1430 | what.
440 | 1435 | 1434 | what that is.
441 | 1439 | 1438 | what you ought to do with it.
442 | 1443 | 1442 | what it does.
443 | 1301 | 1300 | how you might get that.
444 | 1447 | 1446 | what they do.
445 | 1451 | 1450 | what he does.
446 | 1455 | 1454 | what she does.
447 | 1459 | 1458 | what I mean any more.
448 | 1303 | 1302 | how you might get them.
449 | 1309 | 1308 | how you might go there.
450 | 1313 | 1312 | why.
451 | 1317 | 1316 | why that happens
452 | 1321 | 1320 | why you want to do that.
453 | 1171 | 1170 | The thing is
454 | 1207 | 1206 | It distresses me deeply to have to say this
455 | 1175 | 1174 | The trouble is
456 | 1179 | 1178 | As it happens
457 | 1183 | 1182 | It's rather embarrassing
458 | 1187 | 1186 | I feel deeply ill at ease saying this
459 | 1191 | 1190 | The odd thing is
460 | 1195 | 1194 | The funny thing is
461 | 1199 | 1198 | This isn't logical
462 | 1203 | 1202 | This is something I never thought I'd say
463 | 1951 | 1950 | Stop it!
464 | 2231 | 2230 | Tell me less.
465 | 1955 | 1954 | Oh, yes, that's good.
466 | 2019 | 2018 | That's normal.
467 | 1923 | 1922 | That's amazing.
468 | 1919 | 1918 | That's good.
469 | 1687 | 1686 | That's right.
470 | 2127 | 2126 | The day after.
471 | 2123 | 2122 | The day before.
472 | 1855 | 1854 | There!
473 | 1651 | 1650 | If this is a game, you're obviously a loser.
474 | 1891 | 1890 | Thought so.
475 | 2131 | 2130 | Hammerday.
476 | 2135 | 2134 | Rowday.
477 | 2139 | 2138 | Welday.
478 | 2143 | 2142 | Harday.
479 | 2147 | 2146 | Spryday.
480 | 2151 | 2150 | Otherday.
481 | 2155 | 2154 | Flatterday.
482 | 2159 | 2158 | Umph.
483 | 2119 | 2118 | Today is.
484 | 2179 | 2178 | Undoubtedly.
485 | 2063 | 2062 | Very good.
486 | 1463 | 1462 | Dear child you are out of your depth. Have you tried the Bar?
487 | 1573 | 1572 | Tough!
488 | 1059 | 1058 | What kind of fool are you? We're in deep space you dunderhead.
489 | 1061 | 1060 | What kind of worb-brained statement is that? Planets have weather. Space has absence of weather.
490 | 1063 | 1062 | You like weather? How charming.
491 | 1067 | 1066 | If you like weather - we've got the lot here.
492 | 1071 | 1070 | Look, if you like weather go up to the Arboretum - you can play with the weather till the clouds come home.
493 | 1717 | 1716 | What?
494 | 953 | 952 | Dear child you are SO ignorant. Blerontis is where the Starship Titanic was built.
495 | 1643 | 1642 | Never you mind about the frogs.
496 | 1519 | 1518 | That's what I want to know! I don't get to see much sitting here, and since Titania's been down I'm off the network!
497 | 2051 | 2050 | That's what I heard.
498 | 2215 | 2214 | What an idea.
499 | 1589 | 1588 | Time you did something useful.
500 | 1531 | 1530 | Overrated, overspecified, undertested piece of cyberjunk! I could go on!
501 | 1533 | 1532 | Titania's meant to run everything on this ship. Can't even run herself. I could go on.
502 | 1535 | 1534 | Titania's done a complete system crash! And where does that leave all of us Bots? Just running random code in the dark! I could go on.
503 | 1537 | 1536 | Someone needs to go and pull her together. I'd suggest you only you don't look remotely up to the job. I could go on.
504 | 1539 | 1538 | But I won't...
505 | 893 | 892 | Sorry, can't tell you.
506 | 2071 | 2070 | Well what a surprise.
507 | 1563 | 1562 | Brain dead.
508 | 1987 | 1986 | What do you think?
509 | 961 | 960 | Marsinta Drewbish at your service.
510 | 1975 | 1974 | Whatever.
511 | 2059 | 2058 | Whatever you say.
512 | 1627 | 1626 | I don't think you'll be needing anything like that here on this ship.
513 | 663 | 662 | Trying to get some peace and quiet I expect.
514 | 1581 | 1580 | I don't know. A laundromat? A bank? Tell you what, why not try a restaurant? Sounds like a crazy idea, but it might just work.
515 | 1585 | 1584 | Super Galactic Traveler restaurant on any Super Galactic traveler floor. 1st class restaurant, go along the 1st class canal. 2nd class restaurant - come back when it's been built.
516 | 1879 | 1878 | I wouldn't know where to begin.
517 | 665 | 664 | A man whose stomach's had more upgrades than were good for him.
518 | 667 | 666 | A genius in all respects but one: he has NO idea how much a DeskBot's station should incorporate a little privacy.
519 | 669 | 668 | Scraliontis? The Accountant I believe. Half weasel half man.
520 | 1713 | 1712 | Why?
521 | 1983 | 1982 | Why do you think?
522 | 1683 | 1682 | Yes.
523 | 675 | 674 | Oh yes!
524 | 697 | 696 | Yes?
525 | 699 | 698 | Yes. Or do I mean no? It's such fun to tease. It's yes. Yes yes yes yes yes.
526 | 701 | 700 | No. All right. Yes.
527 | 703 | 702 | You are so right, but then you always are.
528 | 707 | 706 | Yes. Divine.
529 | 709 | 708 | In spite of your tragic dress sense you're actually quite bright aren't you?
530 | 713 | 712 | Well who am I to disagree with you.
531 | 711 | 710 | And foolish too.
532 | 719 | 718 | Help yourself.
533 | 723 | 722 | Right.
534 | 727 | 726 | Yes indeed.
535 | 731 | 730 | Well it certainly looks that way.
536 | 679 | 678 | Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes!!!!
537 | 735 | 734 | You'd better believe it.
538 | 739 | 738 | Of course.
539 | 743 | 742 | Go ahead.
540 | 747 | 746 | Do what you want.
541 | 751 | 750 | Definitely.
542 | 755 | 754 | Not a doubt.
543 | 759 | 758 | It's a sure thing.
544 | 763 | 762 | Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Yes.
545 | 775 | 774 | Well this medical breakthrough must be broadcast throughout the galaxy. The termite in SGT Class made an intelligent remark.
546 | 1601 | 1600 | Yes.
547 | 681 | 680 | Yes.
548 | 685 | 684 | Yes.
549 | 687 | 686 | Yes.
550 | 689 | 688 | Yes.
551 | 691 | 690 | Yes.
552 | 693 | 692 | Yes.
553 | 695 | 694 | Yes.
554 | 2175 | 2174 | Yes, and what fun it is.
555 | 2171 | 2170 | Yes, and what fun it was.
556 | 1927 | 1926 | You're amazing.
557 | 1943 | 1942 | Oh, you're really clever.
558 | 1931 | 1930 | You're an idiot.
559 | 1911 | 1910 | You reckon?
560 | 2101 | 2100 | You're right.
561 | 2105 | 2104 | You're wrong.
562 | 2213 | 2212 | Absurd.
563 | 1767 | 1766 | That's really all I know, dear.
564 | 1973 | 1972 | All the time.
565 | 1813 | 1812 | You should ask the BarBot that.
566 | 1833 | 1832 | You ought to talk to the BarBot about that.
567 | 1677 | 1676 | Have you tried asking the BellBot about that dear?
568 | 1801 | 1800 | You should ask the BellBot that.
569 | 1821 | 1820 | You ought to talk to the BellBot about that.
570 | 1673 | 1672 | The DoorBot might be able to help you with that dear.
571 | 1805 | 1804 | You should ask the DoorBot that.
572 | 1825 | 1824 | You ought to talk to the DoorBot about that.
573 | 1809 | 1808 | You should ask the LiftBot that.
574 | 1829 | 1828 | You ought to talk to the LiftBot about that.
575 | 1817 | 1816 | You should ask the Maitre d'Bot that.
576 | 1837 | 1836 | You ought to talk to the Maitre d'Bot about that.
577 | 2013 | 2012 | Because I say so.
578 | 1869 | 1868 | Behind you!
579 | 1873 | 1872 | Behind you?
580 | 1085 | 1084 | Good.
581 | 1121 | 1120 | Terrific.
582 | 1125 | 1124 | Wholly predictable.
583 | 1129 | 1128 | I like that.
584 | 1133 | 1132 | Interesting.
585 | 1137 | 1136 | Intelligent response.
586 | 1141 | 1140 | Mmm.
587 | 1145 | 1144 | Astounding.
588 | 1151 | 1150 | I'm sorry dear, that's enough for now.
589 | 1089 | 1088 | OK.
590 | 1155 | 1154 | You'll forgive me if I take a little break dear.
591 | 1159 | 1158 | You'll forgive me if I don't want to listen to you any more.
592 | 1163 | 1162 | I am a little tired.
593 | 1093 | 1092 | Yes indeed.
594 | 1097 | 1096 | That's fine.
595 | 1101 | 1100 | That's OK.
596 | 1105 | 1104 | All right, all right.
597 | 1109 | 1108 | Staggering.
598 | 1113 | 1112 | Outlandish.
599 | 1117 | 1116 | Perfect.
600 | 2069 | 2068 | But of course.
601 | 1663 | 1662 | Depends who's asking, dear.
602 | 1665 | 1664 | Well, no dear. You're very nice, of course, but you're not really my type.
603 | 927 | 926 | I can't possibly tell you that.
604 | 2221 | 2220 | Carry on.
605 | 2225 | 2224 | Continue.
606 | 2229 | 2228 | Tell me more.
607 | 2209 | 2208 | Charming.
608 | 2085 | 2084 | Company policy.
609 | 2341 | 2340 | Marsinta.
610 | 2377 | 2376 | Yes.
611 | 2637 | 2636 | Typical.
612 | 2641 | 2640 | It's never too late.
613 | 2645 | 2644 | I'm not a taxi.
614 | 2649 | 2648 | Many times.
615 | 2653 | 2652 | Not much recently.
616 | 2381 | 2380 | No.
617 | 2385 | 2384 | Well, maybe.
618 | 2389 | 2388 | Why?
619 | 2393 | 2392 | What for?
620 | 2397 | 2396 | Yes, I do too.
621 | 2401 | 2400 | Do you?
622 | 2405 | 2404 | That's good.
623 | 2409 | 2408 | Never heard of him.
624 | 2413 | 2412 | Never heard of her.
625 | 2345 | 2344 | I do.
626 | 2417 | 2416 | Never heard of them.
627 | 2421 | 2420 | What's one of those.
628 | 2425 | 2424 | You're awfully chatty.
629 | 2429 | 2428 | You're not saying much. Not that I'm complaining.
630 | 2433 | 2432 | That's right.
631 | 2437 | 2436 | Me too.
632 | 2441 | 2440 | All the time.
633 | 2445 | 2444 | Whatever you say.
634 | 2449 | 2448 | Not sure.
635 | 2453 | 2452 | Do what?
636 | 2349 | 2348 | I would.
637 | 2457 | 2456 | Not today thanks.
638 | 2461 | 2460 | I've no idea.
639 | 2465 | 2464 | It is.
640 | 2469 | 2468 | They do.
641 | 2473 | 2472 | They are.
642 | 2477 | 2476 | Could be.
643 | 2481 | 2480 | Sure is.
644 | 2485 | 2484 | What's the point in that?
645 | 2489 | 2488 | Oh, I see.
646 | 2493 | 2492 | Oh, I don't know.
647 | 2353 | 2352 | I wouldn't.
648 | 2497 | 2496 | Love it.
649 | 2501 | 2500 | Not so sure about that.
650 | 2505 | 2504 | I never was a great fan.
651 | 2509 | 2508 | They have.
652 | 2513 | 2512 | A little.
653 | 2517 | 2516 | I know.
654 | 2521 | 2520 | I should think not.
655 | 2525 | 2524 | Many times.
656 | 2529 | 2528 | Never again.
657 | 2533 | 2532 | I might.
658 | 2357 | 2356 | Really?
659 | 2537 | 2536 | It might.
660 | 2541 | 2540 | No can do.
661 | 2545 | 2544 | Well, I'm not.
662 | 2549 | 2548 | That's good.
663 | 2553 | 2552 | A hunch.
664 | 2241 | 2240 | I am.
665 | 2245 | 2244 | You're not.
666 | 2249 | 2248 | You are.
667 | 2253 | 2252 | You will.
668 | 2361 | 2360 | Would you?
669 | 2257 | 2256 | Oh.
670 | 2261 | 2260 | Oh dear.
671 | 2265 | 2264 | Me too.
672 | 2269 | 2268 | Please?
673 | 2273 | 2272 | Yeah, right.
674 | 2281 | 2280 | Isn't she?
675 | 2285 | 2284 | Isn't he?
676 | 2289 | 2288 | Aren't they?
677 | 2293 | 2292 | Won't they?
678 | 2297 | 2296 | Won't she?
679 | 2365 | 2364 | Do you?
680 | 2301 | 2300 | Won't he?
681 | 2305 | 2304 | Does he?
682 | 2309 | 2308 | Does she?
683 | 2313 | 2312 | Do they?
684 | 2317 | 2316 | Go on.
685 | 2321 | 2320 | Is that so?
686 | 2325 | 2324 | Is that right?
687 | 2329 | 2328 | My goodness.
688 | 2333 | 2332 | Uh oh.
689 | 2337 | 2336 | I see.
690 | 2369 | 2368 | Will you?
691 | 2557 | 2556 | No problem.
692 | 2561 | 2560 | That's right.
693 | 2565 | 2564 | Of course.
694 | 2569 | 2568 | Could be.
695 | 2573 | 2572 | Who?
696 | 2577 | 2576 | What?
697 | 2581 | 2580 | Where?
698 | 2585 | 2584 | Why?
699 | 2589 | 2588 | When?
700 | 2593 | 2592 | Is he?
701 | 2373 | 2372 | Are you sure?
702 | 2597 | 2596 | Is she?
703 | 2601 | 2600 | Are they?
704 | 2605 | 2604 | Will he?
705 | 2609 | 2608 | Will she?
706 | 2613 | 2612 | Will they?
707 | 2617 | 2616 | Did he?
708 | 2621 | 2620 | Did she?
709 | 2625 | 2624 | Did they?
710 | 2629 | 2628 | Just like you.
711 | 2633 | 2632 | Just like me.
712 | 1769 | 1768 | Dear oh dear, dear.
713 | 2197 | 2196 | Delightful.
714 | 959 | 958 | Well you've got me there. I'm afraid I just don't know.
715 | 1763 | 1762 | I have nothing more to say.
716 | 2169 | 2168 | Everyday.
717 | 2029 | 2028 | Exactly.
718 | 2041 | 2040 | I expect not.
719 | 2037 | 2036 | I expect so.
720 | 1669 | 1668 | Fancy a bit of a change do you dear? I know, even those big rooms can get a bit stuffy after a while can't they? Give me your PET.
721 | 1901 | 1900 | Fantastic!
722 | 2165 | 2164 | First week of the month.
723 | 967 | 966 | I rather like it.
724 | 971 | 970 | What a rude, rude biped you are.
725 | 975 | 974 | Just because I'm a Bot there's no reason to treat me like one.
726 | 887 | 886 | I can't tell you that.
727 | 891 | 890 | Because of the Reason.
728 | 1777 | 1776 | Why don't you go to the bar?
729 | 1789 | 1788 | Why don't you go to the bilge room?
730 | 1781 | 1780 | Why don't you go to the first class restaurant?
731 | 1785 | 1784 | Why don't you go to the music room?
732 | 1793 | 1792 | Why don't you go to the Parrot's lobby?
733 | 1797 | 1796 | Why don't you go to the Super Galactic Traveler Class Restaurant?
734 | 1773 | 1772 | Good for you, dear.
735 | 1621 | 1620 | Goodbye, dear.
736 | 2205 | 2204 | Great.
737 | 1745 | 1744 | Ha ha ha, dear.
738 | 2025 | 2024 | That happens all the time.
739 | 647 | 646 | If there's anything I can do you must let me know immediately.
740 | 649 | 648 | I do so wish I could make you happier.
741 | 653 | 652 | Oh this cruel, cruel world that has things you do not like within it.
742 | 657 | 656 | Is there anything I can do that might help?
743 | 659 | 658 | I am most terribly, terribly sorry.
744 | 637 | 636 | You know if you want an upgrade you're going to have to be a little more discreet about your likes and dislikes.
745 | 1637 | 1636 | I wish I could upgrade you again dear, but you're first class already.
746 | 2111 | 2110 | Have a nice day.
747 | 1741 | 1740 | I'll have to think about that dear.
748 | 1021 | 1020 | And how are we today dear passenger?
749 | 1027 | 1026 | Greetings biped!
750 | 1049 | 1048 | How are you?
751 | 1057 | 1056 | Nice weather we're having, dear.
752 | 603 | 602 | My word Marsinta you are being helpful today.
753 | 611 | 610 | Might I suggest a detailed examination of Titania's Chamber - after all, that's where the controls are.
754 | 623 | 622 | If I were you I'd defuse the bomb before it goes off.
755 | 583 | 582 | I hear they have lemon trees in the Arboretum you know.
756 | 591 | 590 | They have starlings up on the Promenade Deck you know. I'm sure you of all people will find a way of squashing them.
757 | 1633 | 1632 | You ask me very nicely, dear, and then I see what I can do.
758 | 1595 | 1594 | Oh, as well as can be expected, dear, under the circumstances.
759 | 1053 | 1052 | I'm terrific.
760 | 1599 | 1598 | Oh, well dear, I'm just worried about what's happened to Titania.
761 | 1885 | 1884 | How come?
762 | 1571 | 1570 | Ask the BellBot, dear.
763 | 1553 | 1552 | Well, first of all, dear, I think we need to find out what's happened to her. I could say more...
764 | 1555 | 1554 | I think her brain has been taken to pieces! It's a terrible thing to say about someone, but that's all I can think!
765 | 1557 | 1556 | So all the different bits of her grey matter..., well her colored, glassy matter, I should say have been taken away and hidden. That's what I think. And I could say more.
766 | 1559 | 1558 | By Scraliontis and Brobostigon! Such nice men in their way, but I think they've been led astray. Probably by each other! If you could find some of the pieces I think that would be a help!
767 | 1917 | 1916 | How much?
768 | 1649 | 1648 | What game dear? I didn't know there were any games aboard.
769 | 1567 | 1566 | Well I'm sure the LiftBot will help you, that's what he's there for.
770 | 1905 | 1904 | How did you know?
771 | 1981 | 1980 | How do you think?
772 | 2097 | 2096 | I agree.
773 | 1937 | 1936 | I'm amazing.
774 | 1941 | 1940 | I'm a bot.
775 | 1579 | 1578 | I think that's nature's way of telling you to go and eat something, dear.
776 | 2237 | 2236 | I'm not.
777 | 2045 | 2044 | I'd be very surprised.
778 | 1749 | 1748 | I could.
779 | 1755 | 1754 | I could go on.
780 | 1757 | 1756 | I could say more.
781 | 1735 | 1734 | I did.
782 | 1739 | 1738 | I didn't.
783 | 2099 | 2098 | I disagree.
784 | 1727 | 1726 | I do.
785 | 1731 | 1730 | I don't.
786 | 2009 | 2008 | I don't think so.
787 | 1845 | 1844 | I don't understand.
788 | 1849 | 1848 | I still don't understand.
789 | 1853 | 1852 | I'm really having a lot of difficulty understanding this.
790 | 1681 | 1680 | I know, dear.
791 | 1625 | 1624 | That's very sweet of you dear, but I'm afraid you're wrong. the Parrot is not a nice bird.
792 | 2049 | 2048 | I wouldn't be at all surprised.
793 | 1707 | 1706 | Oh I see, dear.
794 | 1841 | 1840 | I understand.
795 | 2185 | 2184 | Indeed.
796 | 1961 | 1960 | Interesting.
797 | 2089 | 2088 | It is.
798 | 2093 | 2092 | It isn't.
799 | 2077 | 2076 | Oh it's you again.
800 | 2017 | 2016 | Just because.
801 | 1657 | 1656 | They tell you what class you're in, dear.
802 | 1897 | 1896 | Lovely!
803 | 1909 | 1908 | Many's the time.
804 | 2657 | 2656 | It's just what we call it dear.
805 | 1641 | 1640 | Well, I'm rather attached to it, dear.
806 | 847 | 846 | Maybe.
807 | 1617 | 1616 | Maybe.
808 | 851 | 850 | Maybe, maybe not.
809 | 855 | 854 | I wouldn't say no - but then again I wouldn't say yes.
810 | 859 | 858 | Possibly. And also possibly not.
811 | 863 | 862 | Could be.
812 | 867 | 866 | Perhaps. Then again, perhaps not.
813 | 2115 | 2114 | Missing you already.
814 | 2193 | 2192 | Neat.
815 | 1965 | 1964 | Never.
816 | 899 | 898 | Never.
817 | 903 | 902 | All the time.
818 | 907 | 906 | Sometimes.
819 | 911 | 910 | Often.
820 | 915 | 914 | Occasionally.
821 | 919 | 918 | Hardly ever.
822 | 923 | 922 | When the mood's right.
823 | 935 | 934 | From time to time.
824 | 2189 | 2188 | Nice.
825 | 1031 | 1030 | Possibly. Let's give it a little time.
826 | 1037 | 1036 | Good to meet you too.
827 | 1041 | 1040 | The pleasure's all mine.
828 | 1697 | 1696 | No, dear.
829 | 779 | 778 | No.
830 | 823 | 822 | Not a hope.
831 | 827 | 826 | Nope.
832 | 783 | 782 | No no no no no no no!!!!
833 | 1607 | 1606 | No, dear.
834 | 1609 | 1608 | Well, no, I don't think so.
835 | 1611 | 1610 | Well, not really, dear.
836 | 1613 | 1612 | Well, no.
837 | 2277 | 2276 | No way.
838 | 787 | 786 | No.
839 | 839 | 838 | Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. No.
840 | 791 | 790 | No.
841 | 795 | 794 | No.
842 | 799 | 798 | No.
843 | 803 | 802 | No.
844 | 807 | 806 | No.
845 | 809 | 808 | No.
846 | 1469 | 1468 | The BarBot is a teeny weeny bit of a liar.
847 | 2081 | 2080 | I'm afraid that's not company policy.
848 | 1765 | 1764 | I'm sorry, I'd rather not talk about that dear.
849 | 2057 | 2056 | That's not what I heard.
850 | 1693 | 1692 | No doubt about it, dear.
851 | 1701 | 1700 | Don't worry about it dear.
852 | 1771 | 1770 | Oh dear.
853 | 1703 | 1702 | Oh dear, dear.
854 | 1711 | 1710 | Ok dear.
855 | 939 | 938 | I'm sure you're right.
856 | 943 | 942 | That might be a good thing to do and then again it might not.
857 | 947 | 946 | Absolutely.
858 | 951 | 950 | Without a doubt.
859 | 1861 | 1860 | Over there!
860 | 1865 | 1864 | Over there?
861 | 1889 | 1888 | It's a possibility.
862 | 2001 | 2000 | Possibly.
863 | 2005 | 2004 | Possibly not.
864 | 2033 | 2032 | Precisely.
865 | 1005 | 1004 | At the risk of repeating myself -
866 | 1009 | 1008 | I'll say it once and I'll say it again -
867 | 1013 | 1012 | If I've said it once I've said it a hundred times -
868 | 1017 | 1016 | Listen dear. Listen dear. Listen dear. Listen dear. Now dear, do you see what it's like?
869 | 1993 | 1992 | Probably.
870 | 1997 | 1996 | Probably not.
871 | 769 | 768 | Oh how sweet! You got another question right.
872 | 773 | 772 | Extraordinary. You got a question right.
873 | 1473 | 1472 | Do you have science on your planet dear? How terribly forward of you.
874 | 1479 | 1478 | Oh yes dear, I'm sure she's very good.
875 | 1477 | 1476 | Oh yes dear, I'm sure he's very good.
876 | 1723 | 1722 | Really?
877 | 995 | 994 | You're repeating yourself dear.
878 | 1001 | 1000 | You know dear, repeating a not terribly bright question does not increase its chances of being answered.
879 | 2201 | 2200 | Repugnant.
880 | 1877 | 1876 | Right here!
881 | 979 | 978 | Ah, good day. Marsinta here ready to do her best.
882 | 983 | 982 | Ahoy passenger! How can Marsinta help you today?.
883 | 987 | 986 | Yes, you can ring my bell any time.
884 | 991 | 990 | Yes? May I help you?
885 | 1949 | 1948 | You can say that again.
886 | 1969 | 1968 | Sometimes.
887 | 1495 | 1494 | Come on dear, speak up, you needn't be shy.
888 | 1497 | 1496 | You don't seem to have much to say for yourself, dear.
889 | 1499 | 1498 | Cat got your tongue, dear?
890 | 1501 | 1500 | What was that, dear, I missed it.
891 | 1251 | 1250 | but I'm not too sure.
892 | 1287 | 1286 | but I'm having a little trouble working out.
893 | 1255 | 1254 | but I'm not quite certain.
894 | 1259 | 1258 | but I can't quite absolutely recall.
895 | 1263 | 1262 | but I'm having a little trouble remembering.
896 | 1267 | 1266 | but it appears to have slipped my memory.
897 | 1271 | 1270 | but I'm not absolutely certain.
898 | 1275 | 1274 | but I can't say with absolute conviction.
899 | 1279 | 1278 | but I find it difficult to be sure.
900 | 1283 | 1282 | but I couldn't say with total certainty.
901 | 1213 | 1212 | , and I doubt you'll ever understand,
902 | 1247 | 1246 | , and I must say it's quite a rare event for me,
903 | 1217 | 1216 | , and I rather hope you won't take it personally,
904 | 1221 | 1220 | , and you certainly mustn't blame anyone for it,
905 | 1225 | 1224 | , and I'm quite prepared to take the blame myself for it,
906 | 1229 | 1228 | , and don't even think about blaming anyone,
907 | 1235 | 1234 | , and don't think it's got anything to do with you personally,
908 | 1239 | 1238 | , and I'd say this to any of the passengers,
909 | 1243 | 1242 | , and I must say it doesn't often happen to me,
910 | 1291 | 1290 | how.
911 | 1329 | 1328 | why you're going to do that.
912 | 1333 | 1332 | why you keep asking these not very bright questions.
913 | 1337 | 1336 | why you think that's relevant.
914 | 1341 | 1340 | why you persist in being not very bright.
915 | 1345 | 1344 | why you insist on acting in not a very bright manner.
916 | 1349 | 1348 | why you continue to act so strangely.
917 | 1353 | 1352 | who.
918 | 1357 | 1356 | who you mean.
919 | 1361 | 1360 | who did it.
920 | 1365 | 1364 | who moved it.
921 | 1295 | 1294 | how it works.
922 | 1369 | 1368 | who took it.
923 | 1373 | 1372 | who hid it.
924 | 1377 | 1376 | where.
925 | 1381 | 1380 | where it is.
926 | 1385 | 1384 | where they are.
927 | 1389 | 1388 | where it went.
928 | 1393 | 1392 | where they went.
929 | 1397 | 1396 | where it could be.
930 | 1401 | 1400 | where they could be.
931 | 1405 | 1404 | where he is.
932 | 1299 | 1298 | how you might solve that.
933 | 1409 | 1408 | where she is.
934 | 1413 | 1412 | when.
935 | 1417 | 1416 | when we're going to arrive.
936 | 1421 | 1420 | when that happened.
937 | 1425 | 1424 | when - if at all.
938 | 1429 | 1428 | when that'll happen.
939 | 1433 | 1432 | what.
940 | 1437 | 1436 | what that is.
941 | 1441 | 1440 | what you ought to do with it.
942 | 1445 | 1444 | what it does.
943 | 1305 | 1304 | how you might get that.
944 | 1449 | 1448 | what they do.
945 | 1453 | 1452 | what he does.
946 | 1457 | 1456 | what she does.
947 | 1461 | 1460 | what I mean any more.
948 | 1307 | 1306 | how you might get them.
949 | 1311 | 1310 | how you might go there.
950 | 1315 | 1314 | why.
951 | 1319 | 1318 | why that happens
952 | 1323 | 1322 | why you want to do that.
953 | 1325 | 1324 | why you think that.
954 | 1173 | 1172 | The thing is
955 | 1209 | 1208 | It distresses me deeply to have to say this
956 | 1177 | 1176 | The trouble is
957 | 1181 | 1180 | As it happens
958 | 1185 | 1184 | It's rather embarrassing
959 | 1189 | 1188 | I feel deeply ill at ease saying this
960 | 1193 | 1192 | The odd thing is
961 | 1197 | 1196 | The funny thing is
962 | 1201 | 1200 | This isn't logical
963 | 1205 | 1204 | This is something I never thought I'd say
964 | 1953 | 1952 | Stop it!
965 | 1659 | 1658 | Yes dear.
966 | 2233 | 2232 | Tell me less.
967 | 1957 | 1956 | Oh, yes, that's good.
968 | 2021 | 2020 | That's normal.
969 | 1925 | 1924 | That's amazing.
970 | 1921 | 1920 | That's good.
971 | 1689 | 1688 | That's right dear.
972 | 2129 | 2128 | The day after.
973 | 2125 | 2124 | The day before.
974 | 1857 | 1856 | There!
975 | 1653 | 1652 | Not to us, dear, not to us.
976 | 1893 | 1892 | Thought so.
977 | 2133 | 2132 | Hammerday.
978 | 2137 | 2136 | Rowday.
979 | 2141 | 2140 | Welday.
980 | 2145 | 2144 | Harday.
981 | 2149 | 2148 | Spryday.
982 | 2153 | 2152 | Otherday.
983 | 2157 | 2156 | Flatterday.
984 | 2161 | 2160 | Umph.
985 | 2121 | 2120 | Today is.
986 | 2181 | 2180 | Undoubtedly.
987 | 2065 | 2064 | Very good.
988 | 1465 | 1464 | Oh dear, you are out of your depth. Have you tried the Bar?
989 | 1575 | 1574 | I'm sure we'd all like to go home one day.
990 | 1065 | 1064 | You like weather? How charming.
991 | 1069 | 1068 | If you like weather - we've got a very wide selection on board.
992 | 1073 | 1072 | Look, if you like weather go up to the Arboretum - you can play with the weather till the clouds come home.
993 | 1719 | 1718 | What, dear?
994 | 955 | 954 | Blerontis is where the Starship Titanic was built.
995 | 1645 | 1644 | I'd rather not discuss the frogs, if you don't mind, dear.
996 | 2053 | 2052 | That's what I heard.
997 | 2217 | 2216 | What an idea.
998 | 1591 | 1590 | That's the Starship Titanic experience, dear, losing track of time.
999 | 1521 | 1520 | Titania is the most powerful ship's intelligence ever built. I could say more.
1000 | 1523 | 1522 | Leovinus designed Titania to run everything in the ship. All the systems and all the Bots. I could say more.
1001 | 1525 | 1524 | Since she's stopped working, all of us Bots are in a terribly confused state! I could go on.
1002 | 1527 | 1526 | If you could find a way of repairing her, you'd be doing everyone a very great favor! I could go on.
1003 | 1529 | 1528 | But I won't...
1004 | 1667 | 1666 | Metallic.
1005 | 895 | 894 | Sorry, can't tell you.
1006 | 2073 | 2072 | Well what a surprise.
1007 | 1561 | 1560 | She's lost her mind, dear.
1008 | 1989 | 1988 | What do you think?
1009 | 963 | 962 | Marsinta Drewbish at your service.
1010 | 1977 | 1976 | Whatever.
1011 | 2061 | 2060 | Whatever you say.
1012 | 1629 | 1628 | I don't know, dear. I really don't think you'll be needing them. Everything on this ship is very advanced, you know.
1013 | 1583 | 1582 | Well, dear, you could try a restaurant. That might do the trick.
1014 | 1587 | 1586 | Well, it depends what you like, dear. The Starship Titanic dining experience is available on floors.
1015 | 1881 | 1880 | I wouldn't know where to begin.
1016 | 1715 | 1714 | Why?
1017 | 1985 | 1984 | Why do you think?
1018 | 1685 | 1684 | Yes dear.
1019 | 677 | 676 | Oh yes!
1020 | 705 | 704 | You are so right, but then you always are.
1021 | 721 | 720 | Help yourself.
1022 | 725 | 724 | Right.
1023 | 729 | 728 | Yes indeed.
1024 | 733 | 732 | Well it certainly looks that way.
1025 | 737 | 736 | You'd better believe it.
1026 | 741 | 740 | Of course.
1027 | 745 | 744 | Go ahead.
1028 | 749 | 748 | Do what you want.
1029 | 753 | 752 | Definitely.
1030 | 757 | 756 | Not a doubt.
1031 | 761 | 760 | It's a sure thing.
1032 | 765 | 764 | Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Yes.
1033 | 1603 | 1602 | Yes, dear.
1034 | 683 | 682 | Yes.
1035 | 2177 | 2176 | Yes, and what fun it is.
1036 | 2173 | 2172 | Yes, and what fun it was.
1037 | 1929 | 1928 | You're amazing.
1038 | 1945 | 1944 | You're really clever.
1039 | 1933 | 1932 | You're an idiot.
1040 | 1913 | 1912 | You reckon?
1041 | 2103 | 2102 | You're right.
1042 | 2107 | 2106 | You're wrong.
1043 | 3309 | 3308 | Affirmative.
1044 | 3823 | 3822 | All set?
1045 | 3819 | 3818 | So, you're all set?
1046 | 3501 | 3500 | Ow!
1047 | 3505 | 3504 | Ouch!
1048 | 3509 | 3508 | Hey, cut that out.
1049 | 3513 | 3512 | Stop it.
1050 | 3517 | 3516 | Excuse me, do you mind not doing that?
1051 | 3831 | 3830 | It's been real.
1052 | 3129 | 3128 | bit of brain
1053 | 3293 | 3292 | Chickens? You ask about chickens when there's a bomb about to go off?!
1054 | 3297 | 3296 | What? You ask about things like that when there's a bomb about to go off?!
1055 | 3233 | 3232 | Brobostigon.
1056 | 3937 | 3936 | Out of here
1057 | 3843 | 3842 | Well, can't just sit here shining.
1058 | 3577 | 3576 | The ship is controlled by a central intelligence. Maybe all the fuses are also kept in one place.
1059 | 3113 | 3112 | chicken
1060 | 4021 | 4020 | I see from this that you are clever, so I guess you won't need my help to find your room.

1062 | 3269 | 3268 | D'Astragaar.
1063 | 3639 | 3638 | And here's your... Well, I would give it to you, but this is as far as you can go in the demo.

1071 | 3851 | 3850 | Fascinating.
1072 | 3261 | 3260 | Fentible.
1073 | 3609 | 3608 | First Class.

1119 | 3581 | 3580 | Maybe somebody took them for safe keeping?
1120 | 3289 | 3288 | I hear that thing is a bomb! Well, at least if we all die, the Parrot dies too!
1121 | 3915 | 3914 | You mean are they capable of being changed or are you capable of changing them? To the former, yes, to the second, in your dreams.
1122 | 3053 | 3052 | Oh dang. There go my settings again.
1123 | 2843 | 2842 | Well, you'll just have to deal with it. Maybe there are others who should deal with it, but I think they've been dealing with each other.
1124 | 3569 | 3568 | Well maybe it's blown a fuse.
1125 | 2823 | 2822 | My state of health is none of your concern, though I have to say I'm a little stressed by everybody rushing through my lobby in the last few hours.
1126 | 2827 | 2826 | Oh, Brobostigon, Scraliontis, Leovinus, everybody.
1127 | 3923 | 3922 | You first find out where they are, then you walk to where they are, then you stand in front of them, lean over and change them.
1128 | 3389 | 3388 | That girl needs to get her head together. You have to find all the bits.
1129 | 2941 | 2940 | I'm sure the LiftBot will get you there, if you can get a word in edgeways.
1130 | 2985 | 2984 | We are very, very lost indeed. So lost I don't think we'll ever be found again. And I can't help wonder why.
1131 | 3605 | 3604 | Old enough to be your mother. Now cut it out and get on.
1132 | 4003 | 4002 | Are you indeed? Well we shall see about that shan't we?
1133 | 2835 | 2834 | Big deal. I wish that I could say the same for some of the other people who've been through my lobby recently.
1134 | 2881 | 2880 | Fascinating. Do tell me less.
1135 | 3093 | 3092 | This is all just a game to you, isn't it? Here we all are in the last stages of mental disintegration, careering through space in an abandoned cruise ship, and you just want to play at puzzles!
1136 | 2889 | 2888 | Well, you didn't hear it from me, but first those two, Scraliontis and Brobostigon come on board with some so called filing cabinet. I could say more.
1137 | 3635 | 3634 | The Maitre D is just a tired old menu-driven has-been. His best is behind him.
1138 | 2851 | 2850 | Ah, what's your point?
1139 | 3887 | 3886 | What you think I'm some kind of gossip? Get outta here!
1140 | 4039 | 4038 | Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Oh YEAH? You go outside and say that!
1141 | 3101 | 3100 | Huh. You again. Did you find that
1142 | 3109 | 3108 | you were looking for earlier?
1143 | 3149 | 3148 | Huh you again. Did you find that thing you were looking for earlier?
1144 | 3157 | 3156 | Huh you again. Did you find that
1145 | 3165 | 3164 | you were looking for earlier?
1146 | 2949 | 2948 | Pluck my nostril hair, baby! Is that your job? No. Is carrying your bags my job? No. Is it the BellBot's job? Bingo! Hey, Krage! Come over here and pluck some nostril hair. Or carry bags. Or whatever.
1147 | 3029 | 3028 | Go there yourself. There's been enough running around on this ship. I'm going to stay here and mind my own business, and anyway I've been welded.
1148 | 3081 | 3080 | Last I heard it was. I'm the DeskBot and nobody's sacked me yet.
1149 | 3907 | 3906 | They are the things that determine exactly how each of the different Bots behaves, which in my opinion, is uniformly badly.
1150 | 3073 | 3072 | Well far be it from me to say that which should not be said, but seeing as you're probably too dimwitted to understand, there's probably no harm in saying that my niceness is set to low and my gossipiness is set to high. So what's wrong with that? Nothing.
1151 | 3001 | 3000 | I wouldn't hold out much hope about that. How many lawyers you got?
1152 | 3003 | 3002 | We got more. How big are yours?
1153 | 3005 | 3004 | Ours are bigger.
1154 | 2861 | 2860 | I think about what I see.
1155 | 2863 | 2862 | People. Things. Parrots. Whatever. Even bombs sometimes. I mean, I don't like to pry, but when I see a bomb I think, 'Hmm. There's a bomb'.
1156 | 3589 | 3588 | Just a fancy elevator.
1157 | 2859 | 2858 | I am the DeskBot. I sit here. When I'm not being bothered by damn passengers, I watch and I think.
1158 | 3625 | 3624 | He's so precious about his damn music, his damn menu, his damn fencing etiquette. Let me give you a bit of advice. Just go back up there and kick ass.
1159 | 3985 | 3984 | Well, I've often wondered that myself, and if you find out perhaps you'd tell me.
1160 | 3993 | 3992 | That no good filthy creature hasn't got any cellpoint settings. Don't you think if it did have somebody would have changed them long ago? Preferably to dead!
1161 | 3999 | 3998 | You think a primitive bit of mechanical flatulence needs cellpoint settings? It hasn't got any, dumbo.
1162 | 2993 | 2992 | She's lost her mind. Literally. Or should I say it's been lost for her. Taken apart and lost. That's just my guess, of course, but why else was everyone running around the ship last night?
1163 | 3891 | 3890 | I don't see that it's any of your business, but they are niceness and gossipiness.
1164 | 3899 | 3898 | Mind you own business you appalling busybody, I have no intention of telling you, though if I had you'd learn that my niceness as low and my gossipiness was high soon enough.
1165 | 3213 | 3212 | It's just what it looks like. It's just the desk.
1166 | 3221 | 3220 | It's just what it looks like. It's just the door.
1167 | 3197 | 3196 | It's just what it looks like. It's just the Succ-U-Bus.
1168 | 3205 | 3204 | It's just what it looks like. It's just the wall.
1169 | 3667 | 3666 | See if you can figure it out. It's a Lobby. It's the one you embarked into. Hence, Embarkation Lobby. Seems pretty quiet now, but you should have seen who was coming and going last night.
1170 | 3931 | 3930 | Well, they're not in here, they're not in the Parrot Lobby, they're not in the Creators Chamber, so that means they must be in the Sculpture Chamber, doesn't it.
1171 | 2901 | 2900 | Blerontis. And since we're relying on you to save us here, I don't expect I'll be seeing it again.
1172 | 3675 | 3674 | Zark knows. Doing something stupid and irritating I expect. BellBot!
1173 | 2977 | 2976 | Behind us. And since our only chance of fixing the ship and finding it again is you I expect it will remain behind us.
1174 | 2867 | 2866 | How should I know. I just sit here. I observe. But I can only observe what's in here, seeing as I'm welded to the spot.
1175 | 3981 | 3980 | Go out of here, trying not to look as furtive as Brobostigon and Scraliontis did last night when they went through here, give the Parrot lobby the widest possible berth if I were you, go past the Top of the Well and you'll find it opposite the Sculpture Chamber.
1176 | 4009 | 4008 | and you will also find that you can't get in without an upgrade to second class.
1177 | 3683 | 3682 | Zark knows. Doing something stupid and irritating I expect. Hey! DoorBot!
1178 | 3701 | 3700 | At the Top of the Well. If they're functioning. You heard of going to hell in a handcart? Ever wonder what a handcart is? This is a handcart. A big glossy handcart.
1179 | 2969 | 2968 | Vastan. At least that's where we were heading till your stupid house got in the way. Now, who knows?
1180 | 3013 | 3012 | The ship that couldn't possibly go wrong went wrong before it could even pick up any. Ha!
1181 | 3021 | 3020 | The BarBot's in the Bar. And he's screwed to the floor, I'm glad to report.
1182 | 3691 | 3690 | The LiftBot is to be found in all four of the elevators. If you've been looking for an opportunity to discuss rare and unpleasant wars and skin conditions, now's your chance.
1183 | 2957 | 2956 | And what exactly were you going to do on one of those? No, don't tell me. I don't want bathroom talk in my lobby. You don't need one.
1184 | 2961 | 2960 | Then wait till you get back to your own world!
1185 | 3041 | 3040 | Who built everything? Mr. Smarty-pants Leovinus. Is he as clever as he thinks he is? I wonder.
1186 | 2865 | 2864 | Who do you think? Scraliontis and Brobostigon.
1187 | 3713 | 3712 | Your upgrade includes an improved model of the PET.
1188 | 3835 | 3834 | Gotta go.
1189 | 3839 | 3838 | Gotta run.
1190 | 3141 | 3140 | hammer
1191 | 3811 | 3810 | Hmmm.
1192 | 3181 | 3180 | Hmmm...
1193 | 3065 | 3064 | Go ask the DoorBot. Or the BellBot.
1194 | 3441 | 3440 | I just don't know - and I don't suppose you do either.
1195 | 3445 | 3444 | I've racked my brain all the way from Blerontis, but I just don't know the answer.
1196 | 3393 | 3392 | You have to find all the bits. She still needs her
1197 | 3417 | 3416 | Auditory Center.
1198 | 3433 | 3432 | Central Intelligence Core.
1199 | 3409 | 3408 | left ear.
1200 | 3401 | 3400 | left eye.

1207 | 3437 | 3436 | Vision Center.
1208 | 3549 | 3548 | Change to Designer Room Number mode in the PET, and then drag the code for the room you want.
1209 | 3545 | 3544 | You put an object in the tray, use your PET to give the succubus the chevron code for the room you want to send it to, and off it goes. The sir, madam or thing at the other end then presses their receive button and out it pops, fresh as a doozy.
1210 | 3557 | 3556 | Pop into the Real World mode in your PET and I'm sure you'll see the option you seek.
1211 | 3553 | 3552 | Select the Personal Baggage mode in your PET, and then drag the thing into it.
1212 | 3561 | 3560 | Use the PET Remote Thingummy mode. Choose the thing you want to control, and then... control it.
1213 | 3305 | 3304 | Immediately.
1214 | 3461 | 3460 | Immediately.
1215 | 4027 | 4026 | It's a desk... It's my desk.
1216 | 3321 | 3320 | It's right behind you.
1217 | 3317 | 3316 | It's right here.
1218 | 3481 | 3480 | Just missed it.
1219 | 3253 | 3252 | Krage.
1220 | 3807 | 3806 | Well, lah di dah.
1221 | 3277 | 3276 | Drewbish.
1222 | 3473 | 3472 | Later.
1223 | 4017 | 4016 | I see from this that you are lazy, so I'll try to keep it quick.
1224 | 3117 | 3116 | lemon
1225 | 3229 | 3228 | Leovinus.
1226 | 3137 | 3136 | long stick
1227 | 3265 | 3264 | Marsinta.
1228 | 3245 | 3244 | Me.
1229 | 3281 | 3280 | I haven't got a middle name. Never saw the need.
1230 | 3485 | 3484 | If you hurry you might just make it.
1231 | 3847 | 3846 | Huh, modern technology.
1232 | 3313 | 3312 | It would not be my pleasure.
1233 | 3457 | 3456 | Never.
1234 | 2661 | 2660 | Welcome guest number... er, one, to the most glamorous galactic cruiseship experience in the whole of the space-time continuum, the Starship Titanic, the ship that cannot possibly go wrong. Ha! My name's Drewbish, Marsinta Drewbish. I am the DeskBot. Do you have a reservation?
1235 | 2663 | 2662 | I very much doubt it! Name?
1236 | 2673 | 2672 | Wrong! But I see that Fentible thinks we should take you on board anyway. Softhearted fool. I don't see that you're going to be of any help. As far as I'm concerned you're just a freeloader. Ah well.
1237 | 2665 | 2664 | Hmmm, we do seem to have someone of that name here. Probably just a coincidence. A bit of a frog fancier. Of course, we only use that information for blackmail purposes. As far as I'm concerned you're just a freeloader. Ah well.
1238 | 2671 | 2670 | Hmmm, we seem to have someone of that name here. But it's a very popular name, so as far as I'm concerned your just a freeloader. Ah well.
1239 | 2667 | 2666 | Hmmm, we do seem to have someone of that name here. Probably just a coincidence. A bit of a
1240 | 2669 | 2668 | fancier. Of course, we only use that information for blackmail purposes. As far as I'm concerned you're just a freeloader. Ah well.
1241 | 2679 | 2678 | You've been assigned to a Super Galactic Traveler Class room. Don't get your hopes up. There's your room number.
1242 | 2681 | 2680 | Good luck!
1243 | 2813 | 2812 | Any questions?
1244 | 2815 | 2814 | Ask the BellBot.
1245 | 2675 | 2674 | I thought not! But I see that Fentible thinks we should take you on board. Huh, softhearted fool. I don't see that you're going to be any help. As far as I'm concerned your just a freeloader. Ah well.
1246 | 2677 | 2676 | Better get you checked in.
1247 | 2923 | 2922 | It's next to Elevator 1.
1248 | 2925 | 2924 | It's next to Elevator 2.
1249 | 2927 | 2926 | It's next to Elevator 3.
1250 | 2929 | 2928 | It's next to Elevator 4.
1251 | 2933 | 2932 | What's your problem? Are you innumerate?
1252 | 2659 | 2658 | NOT YET, NOT YET !
1253 | 3377 | 3376 | Oh, sorry.
1254 | 3381 | 3380 | I'm most dreadfully sorry.
1255 | 3791 | 3790 | OK.
1256 | 3873 | 3872 | Ouch.
1257 | 3875 | 3874 | Ouch that hurt.
1258 | 3877 | 3876 | Don't do that.
1259 | 3879 | 3878 | I said don't do that.
1260 | 3881 | 3880 | I will not be prodded!
1261 | 3883 | 3882 | Prod off!
1262 | 4059 | 4058 | I don't believe in all that kind of stuff. Aliens? Ha, give me a break.
1263 | 4071 | 4070 | I don't dance I'm afraid. It's a bit hard when you're welded to the furniture.
1264 | 4067 | 4066 | I'm afraid we don't do product placement on this ship.
1265 | 4063 | 4062 | If you're a music fan, maybe you should try and introduce a little harmony into the music room.
1266 | 4075 | 4074 | So you can talk the talk. Can you walk the walk? I'd like to see you navigate a ship like this!
1267 | 4043 | 4042 | Science? What has science ever done for anybody? Who needs talking desklamps anyway?
1268 | 4047 | 4046 | What did he do, invent the wheel? What's wrong with a nice triangle, that's what I want to know.
1269 | 4031 | 4030 | I'm dawdling as quickly as I can.
1270 | 4051 | 4050 | Is that someone you met hanging round the water cooler?
1271 | 4055 | 4054 | Call that a book? It's just a pack of lies written by some oversexed Welsh parrot!
1272 | 3301 | 3300 | Right away.
1273 | 3465 | 3464 | Right away.

1294 | 3169 | 3168 | Huh...
1295 | 3185 | 3184 | Atchoo...
1296 | 3189 | 3188 | Atchoo...
1297 | 3855 | 3854 | So what?
1298 | 3469 | 3468 | Soon.
1299 | 3521 | 3520 | Sorry?
1300 | 3525 | 3524 | Speak up.
1301 | 3529 | 3528 | Could you repeat that please, I didn't hear you.
1302 | 3533 | 3532 | Huh?.
1303 | 3537 | 3536 | Space, the final frontier.
1304 | 4015 | 4014 | I see from this that you are stupid, so I'll try to keep it simple.
1305 | 4019 | 4018 | I see from this that you are stupid and lazy, so I guess I'll be seeing a lot of you.
1306 | 4023 | 4022 | I see from this that you are stupid and lazy, so you'll no doubt get on well with the BellBot.
1307 | 3795 | 3794 | Sure.
1308 | 3799 | 3798 | Sure thing.
1309 | 3285 | 3284 | I hear that thing is a bomb! Be careful!
1310 | 3913 | 3912 | Maybe.
1311 | 3049 | 3048 | Oh dang. There go my settings again.
1312 | 2839 | 2838 | Get over it.
1313 | 3565 | 3564 | Well maybe it's blown a fuse.
1314 | 2819 | 2818 | None of your business.
1315 | 3921 | 3920 | First you find them, then you change them.
1316 | 3385 | 3384 | That girl needs to get her head together. You have to find all the bits.
1317 | 2937 | 2936 | Jump. Or you could ask a LiftBot.
1318 | 2981 | 2980 | We're deep in interstellar space with no navigation. How lost does that sound?
1319 | 3601 | 3600 | Too old for you, dear.
1320 | 4001 | 4000 | I'm not surprised.
1321 | 2831 | 2830 | Oh good.
1322 | 2877 | 2876 | Fascinating.
1323 | 3089 | 3088 | Yeah. What exactly are you doing here?
1324 | 2885 | 2884 | Mind your own damn business.
1325 | 2893 | 2892 | Then a while later, Leovinus himself came aboard. That's all I saw. There was a lot of noise later on, but I couldn't hear. That's all.
1326 | 3631 | 3630 | Oh, just humor him. He's a stupid, weak man.
1327 | 2847 | 2846 | Uh huh.
1328 | 3659 | 3658 | I do wish they wouldn't do this! It's very bad for passenger discipline! Oh very well, let me see.
1329 | 4037 | 4036 | Same to you with knobs on.
1330 | 3097 | 3096 | Did you find that
1331 | 3105 | 3104 | you were looking for earlier?
1332 | 3145 | 3144 | Ah, I see you found that thing you were after.
1333 | 3153 | 3152 | Ah, I see you found that
1334 | 3161 | 3160 | you were after.
1335 | 2945 | 2944 | You think I'm a BellBot?
1336 | 3025 | 3024 | Go there yourself. I'm staying here. I'm welded.
1337 | 3077 | 3076 | You got it.
1338 | 3905 | 3904 | They are the personality parameters for each of the Bots.
1339 | 3069 | 3068 | My niceness is set to low and my gossipiness is set to low. Deal with it.
1340 | 2997 | 2996 | Nothing.
1341 | 3585 | 3584 | Just a fancy elevator.
1342 | 2855 | 2854 | I am the DeskBot.
1343 | 3621 | 3620 | How long have you got?
1344 | 3627 | 3626 | Not enough.
1345 | 3983 | 3982 | Ask 'em yourself.
1346 | 3991 | 3990 | They're too primitive to have any.
1347 | 2989 | 2988 | She's lost her mind. Literally. Or should I say it's been lost for her. Taken apart and lost.
1348 | 3889 | 3888 | Niceness and gossipiness.
1349 | 3897 | 3896 | My niceness is low and so is my gossipiness. Punk.
1350 | 3209 | 3208 | Mind your own business. Search me. No idea. A desk.
1351 | 3217 | 3216 | Mind your own business. Search me. No idea. A door.
1352 | 3193 | 3192 | Mind your own business. Search me. No idea. A Suc-U-Bus.
1353 | 3201 | 3200 | Mind your own business. Search me. No idea. A wall.
1354 | 3663 | 3662 | Embarkation Lobby!
1355 | 3929 | 3928 | In the Sculpture Chamber.
1356 | 2897 | 2896 | Blerontis. What's it to you?
1357 | 3671 | 3670 | BellBot!
1358 | 2973 | 2972 | Behind us.
1359 | 3679 | 3678 | DoorBot!
1360 | 3697 | 3696 | At the Top of the Well.
1361 | 2965 | 2964 | Vastan.
1362 | 3009 | 3008 | Biggest cruise ship ever. No passengers. Stupid eh? Ha!
1363 | 3017 | 3016 | The BarBot's in the Bar.
1364 | 3687 | 3686 | The LiftBot is to be found in all four of the elevators.
1365 | 2953 | 2952 | There aren't any. The designers forgot. You'll just have to cross your legs.
1366 | 3037 | 3036 | Leovinus, of course.
1367 | 3709 | 3708 | Did you breathe on it? Don't answer that.
1368 | 3333 | 3332 | Thank you.
1369 | 3337 | 3336 | All in a day's work.
1370 | 3341 | 3340 | My pleasure.
1371 | 3345 | 3344 | Glad to help.
1372 | 3349 | 3348 | If there's anything else I can do to help, please hesitate to ask.
1373 | 3241 | 3240 | The Gat.
1374 | 3827 | 3826 | Well, there you go.
1375 | 3133 | 3132 | thing
1376 | 3617 | 3616 | Super Galactic Traveler Class. That means riff raff.
1377 | 3225 | 3224 | Titania.
1378 | 3497 | 3496 | Try the bar.
1379 | 3493 | 3492 | Try the Restaurant.
1380 | 3787 | 3786 | Uh huh.
1381 | 3173 | 3172 | Ummm...
1382 | 3353 | 3352 | Up and down.
1383 | 3641 | 3640 | I've assigned you to a Second Class Stateroom,
1384 | 3643 | 3642 | which you will reach by
1385 | 3645 | 3644 | Don't get drunk in the bar, don't annoy the musicians, don't fiddle with the Pellerator, don't touch the artwork, and if you go up to the promenade deck don't scuff the woodwork! There you are. And it's better than you deserve.
1386 | 3325 | 3324 | We're already there.
1387 | 3061 | 3060 | They control my mood. The DoorBot knows more about how it works than I do.
1388 | 3369 | 3368 | Oh, things.
1389 | 3033 | 3032 | A wall.
1390 | 3541 | 3540 | You'll need to use your code to find your stateroom. You can also drag codes from your PET to tell the Succ-U-Bus where to send something, or to tell an Elevator or Pellerator where to take you.
1391 | 3085 | 3084 | Check in. What do you think? Some people ask for upgrades. Nobody gets one.
1392 | 3705 | 3704 | I thought you were on board to help figure out what's wrong with the ship, or are you just going to wander round poking your nose into rooms that are nothing to do with you, picking up anything that isn't nailed down and bleating for the DoorBot or BellBot whenever you get stuck?
1393 | 3803 | 3802 | So what's new?
1394 | 3057 | 3056 | My Cellpoint settings.
1395 | 3373 | 3372 | Some stuff I had to do.
1396 | 3863 | 3862 | Whatever.
1397 | 3449 | 3448 | Too late.
1398 | 3453 | 3452 | It's 'now'. You'd better hurry before it's 'too late'.
1399 | 3489 | 3488 | Whenever you like.
1400 | 3573 | 3572 | I don't know. Perhaps you should look for a fuse box?
1401 | 2905 | 2904 | It's recorded in your PET.
1402 | 2913 | 2912 | It's better than you deserve.

1418 | 4013 | 4012 | You know I won an award once? Yeah, employee of the month. What a month that was. You can just imagine!
1419 | 3249 | 3248 | You.
1420 | 3815 | 3814 | So, you're all set.
1421 | 3859 | 3858 | You got it.
1422 | 3593 | 3592 | Yes.
1423 | 3597 | 3596 | No.
1424 | 3329 | 3328 | You're standing in it.
1425 | 3307 | 3306 | Affirmative.
1426 | 3821 | 3820 | All set?

1429 | 3733 | 3732 | angelheart.
1430 | 3817 | 3816 | So, you're all set?
1431 | 3499 | 3498 | Ow!
1432 | 3503 | 3502 | Ouch!
1433 | 3507 | 3506 | Hey, cut that out.
1434 | 3511 | 3510 | Stop it.
1435 | 3515 | 3514 | Excuse me, do you mind not doing that?
1436 | 3829 | 3828 | It's been real.
1437 | 3127 | 3126 | bit of brain
1438 | 3291 | 3290 | Chickens? You ask about chickens when there's a bomb about to go off?!
1439 | 3295 | 3294 | What dear? You ask a thing like that when there's a bomb about to go off?!
1440 | 3767 | 3766 | booblywooblykins.
1441 | 3231 | 3230 | Brobostigon.
1442 | 3757 | 3756 | bunny rabbit.
1443 | 3841 | 3840 | Well, can't just sit here shining.
1444 | 3575 | 3574 | The ship is controlled by a central intelligence. Maybe all the fuses are also kept in one place.
1445 | 3745 | 3744 | my little cauliflower.

1452 | 3637 | 3636 | And here's your... Well, I would give it to you, but this is as far as you can go in the demo.
1453 | 3475 | 3474 | Earlier.
1454 | 3747 | 3746 | my little glass of elderberry cordial.
1455 | 3175 | 3174 | Ohhh...
1456 | 3849 | 3848 | Fascinating.
1457 | 3259 | 3258 | Fentible.
1458 | 3607 | 3606 | First Class.

1461 | 3255 | 3254 | Fortillian.
1462 | 3579 | 3578 | Maybe somebody took them for safe keeping?
1463 | 3287 | 3286 | I hear that thing is a bomb! I hope we're not all going to die, dear!
1464 | 3919 | 3918 | If anybody can, dear heart, I'm sure you can.
1465 | 3051 | 3050 | Whoops! There go my settings again. I wonder how things will turn out now?
1466 | 2841 | 2840 | Oh dear, I feel so bad about your house. I know who ought to be able to help you, but I don't know what's happened to them.
1467 | 3567 | 3566 | Perhaps it has blown a fuse, dear?
1468 | 2821 | 2820 | I'm fine, dearikins, which is more than can be said for some of the people who've been through this lobby in the last few hours.
1469 | 2825 | 2824 | Oh, Brobostigon, Scraliontis, Leovinus, everybody.
1470 | 3927 | 3926 | Oh, it's really terribly easy, I believe, dear, you just pull the levers on the cellpoints.
1471 | 3387 | 3386 | You'll have to help her get her head together.
1472 | 2939 | 2938 | I'm sure the LiftBot will be very happy to assist you, my poppet.
1473 | 2983 | 2982 | Very lost, dear. There's no means of knowing where we are at all.
1474 | 3603 | 3602 | As young as spring time. Which reminds me. Have you been to the Arboretum yet? They have a very nice spring there? And a nice fall as well.
1475 | 4007 | 4006 | Well, if you think that's wise, dear. I always like a little adventure of course, but it doesn't always turn out well, does it?
1476 | 2833 | 2832 | I'm very glad to hear that, dear. I wish that I could say the same for some of the other people who've been through my lobby recently.
1477 | 2879 | 2878 | Fascinating, dear. Do tell me more.
1478 | 3091 | 3090 | Well, sometimes the Succ-U-Bus is a bit of a puzzle to me. Is that the sort of thing you meant, sweetheart?
1479 | 2887 | 2886 | Well, it's really not my business to say, but first Scraliontis and Brobostigon came aboard with this kind of filing cabinet thing. I could say more!
1480 | 3633 | 3632 | Well the Maitre D does have a weakness, but he says that it's behind him now.
1481 | 2849 | 2848 | And you. Very nice. Very nice indeed.
1482 | 3885 | 3884 | Oh, I couldn't possibly say. I'm not a gossip, dear.
1483 | 4035 | 4034 | Now, I know you're upset about something, but sharp words will cut your mouth, dear.
1484 | 3099 | 3098 | Ah there you are. Did you find that
1485 | 3107 | 3106 | you were looking for earlier?
1486 | 3147 | 3146 | Ah there you are, dear. Did you find that thing you were looking for earlier?
1487 | 3155 | 3154 | Ah there you are, dear.. Did you find that
1488 | 3163 | 3162 | you were looking for earlier?
1489 | 2947 | 2946 | That's the BellBot's job, dear. I'll just see if he's around. Oh Krage!
1490 | 3027 | 3026 | I wish I could, but a welded Bot got to stay where a welded Bot's been welded.
1491 | 3079 | 3078 | That's right, and I'm the one who does it.
1492 | 3653 | 3652 | I've assigned you to a First Class Stateroom
1493 | 3655 | 3654 | which you will reach by
1494 | 3657 | 3656 | Oh, you're going to love First Class, beautiful rooms, none of those nasty lavatory things, there's the lovely Restaurant, the Canal with the lovely RowBot who sings for you, such a lovely voice, the Arboretum for when you want to commune with nature a little, there you are. It's lovely in the Arboretum at this time of year. And if you don't agree, you can always select the time of year of your choice.
1495 | 2869 | 2868 | Do you think so, dear? I think it may just have been a filing cabinet.
1496 | 3911 | 3910 | They are the personality parameters for each of the Bots, cherub.
1497 | 3071 | 3070 | Well, dear, I don't know if I should really be saying this, but since it is you I will just mention that my niceness is set to high and my gossipiness is set to high, dear.
1498 | 2999 | 2998 | Well, I wish I could offer you any comfort on that score dear, but I've never known anybody sue the company successfully.
1499 | 3587 | 3586 | It's a kind of elevator only more complicated.
1500 | 2857 | 2856 | I am the DeskBot, dear. I sit here all day, I attend to passengers' needs and I... well, I see a lot of comings and goings. I try not to notice of course, but sometimes it's hard.
1501 | 3623 | 3622 | He says it's behind him, honeypie, and I'm sure he's right.
1502 | 3989 | 3988 | Oh, that's not the sort of thing we really know about each other, though I won't pretend we don't try to guess sometimes! But I think you'll have to ask them yourself, dear.
1503 | 3997 | 3996 | I don't think it has any, really, dear. Too rudimentary.
1504 | 2991 | 2990 | She's lost her mind, dear. Or it's been lost for her. Or misplaced, I should say. I think that there's been a lot of very naughty running around here. All over the place they were last night.
1505 | 3895 | 3894 | Well, that's rather a personal question, dear, but seeing as it's you, I'll tell you that they are niceness and gossipiness.
1506 | 3903 | 3902 | Oh, well I don't know if I should really say, but since my gossipiness is currently high - oh dear, I've let that out haven't I? - I suppose you won't be surprised to learn that my niceness is high dear.
1507 | 3211 | 3210 | Well, I think that's just the desk.
1508 | 3219 | 3218 | Well, I think that's just the door.
1509 | 3195 | 3194 | Well, I think that's just the Succ-U-Bus.
1510 | 3203 | 3202 | Well, I think that's just the wall.
1511 | 3665 | 3664 | This is the Embarkation Lobby, dear, which is where I ply my trade. It looks pretty empty now, but last night there were all sorts of people coming through it!
1512 | 3935 | 3934 | They're all rather fetchingly displayed around the Sculpture Chamber, heart.
1513 | 2899 | 2898 | Blerontis, dear. Such a nice place. You should visit if you get the chance. That's if you manage to fix the ship.
1514 | 3673 | 3672 | Oh, expect he's rummaging around somewhere, you never can tell with those boys. I'll just call him for you, dear. Oh Krage!
1515 | 2975 | 2974 | Behind us, dear. I do hope we will get back there one day, but first we need you to fix the ship.
1516 | 2873 | 2872 | I've no idea, sweetness. It was probably nothing anyway.
1517 | 3681 | 3680 | Oh, expect he's rummaging around somewhere, you never can tell with those boys. I'll just call him for you, dear. Oh Fentible!
1518 | 3699 | 3698 | At the Top of the Well, but I don't know what sort of state the elevators are in. I heard a lot of banging around. Be careful which one you take, dear.
1519 | 2967 | 2966 | We were heading for Vastan. Now we're lost, and will probably remain lost until you manage to fix the ship for us.
1520 | 3011 | 3010 | We never got as far as Vastan, dear, where we were supposed to pick up the passengers.
1521 | 3019 | 3018 | The BarBot's in the Bar. Old charmer that he is.
1522 | 3689 | 3688 | Nobby is in four of the elevators, dear. You'll enjoy him, if you like talking about the war an awful lot.
1523 | 3693 | 3692 | That's a very good question, dear. None of us have been able to figure it out.
1524 | 2955 | 2954 | We find that most of our first and second class passengers have transcended the need for such things. Let's not talk about it dear.
1525 | 3039 | 3038 | Why, Leovinus of course, who else?
1526 | 2871 | 2870 | Scraliontis and Brobostigon. They just wheeled it through. Probably quite innocent.
1527 | 3711 | 3710 | To reflect your enhanced status, my sweetheart. It's just a little thing we like to do. Nice, don't you think?
1528 | 3759 | 3758 | my sweet little gerbil.
1529 | 3833 | 3832 | Gotta go.
1530 | 3837 | 3836 | Gotta run.
1531 | 3139 | 3138 | hammer
1532 | 3761 | 3760 | my little harvest mouse.
1533 | 3765 | 3764 | heart.
1534 | 3809 | 3808 | Hmmm.
1535 | 3179 | 3178 | Arghh...
1536 | 3063 | 3062 | You'd better ask the DoorBot. Or the BellBot.
1537 | 3439 | 3438 | I just don't know - I'm sure you'll think of something, dear.
1538 | 3443 | 3442 | I've racked my brain all the way from Blerontis, but I just don't know the answer.
1539 | 3391 | 3390 | She still needs her

1551 | 3547 | 3546 | Change to Designer Room Number mode in the PET, and then drag the code for the room you want.
1552 | 3543 | 3542 | You put an object in the tray, use your PET to give the succubus the chevron code for the room you want to send it to, and off it goes. The sir, madam or thing at the other end then presses their receive button and out it pops, fresh as a doozy.
1553 | 3555 | 3554 | Pop into the Real World mode in your PET and I'm sure you'll see the option you seek.
1554 | 3551 | 3550 | Select the Personal Baggage mode in your PET, and then drag the thing into it.
1555 | 3559 | 3558 | Use the PET Remote Thingummy mode. Choose the thing you want to control, and then... control it.
1556 | 3783 | 3782 | I'm sorry
1557 | 3303 | 3302 | Immediately.
1558 | 3459 | 3458 | Immediately.
1559 | 4025 | 4024 | It's a desk... It's my desk.
1560 | 3319 | 3318 | It's right behind you.
1561 | 3315 | 3314 | It's right here.
1562 | 3479 | 3478 | Just missed it.
1563 | 3251 | 3250 | Krage.
1564 | 3805 | 3804 | Well, lah di dah.

1580 | 3279 | 3278 | I haven't got a middle name. Never saw the need.
1581 | 3483 | 3482 | If you hurry you might just make it.
1582 | 3845 | 3844 | Huh, modern technology.
1583 | 3311 | 3310 | It would be my pleasure.
1584 | 3455 | 3454 | Never.
1585 | 2915 | 2914 | It's next to Elevator 1 dear.
1586 | 2917 | 2916 | It's next to Elevator 2 dear.
1587 | 2919 | 2918 | It's next to Elevator 3 dear.
1588 | 2921 | 2920 | It's next to Elevator 4 dear.
1589 | 2931 | 2930 | Is that helpful? Is that what you're asking?
1590 | 3375 | 3374 | Oh, sorry.
1591 | 3379 | 3378 | I'm most dreadfully sorry.
1592 | 3789 | 3788 | OK.

1596 | 3865 | 3864 | Please don't do that.
1597 | 3867 | 3866 | I'd rather you didn't do that dear.
1598 | 3869 | 3868 | I'd really rather you didn't do that.
1599 | 3871 | 3870 | Please dear, if you keep doing that, I can't answer for the consequences.
1600 | 3741 | 3740 | my little pumpkin.
1601 | 3743 | 3742 | pussycat.
1602 | 4057 | 4056 | Well, there's certainly something strange going on somewhere, isn't there? I know there is on this ship.
1603 | 4069 | 4068 | I don't dance I'm afraid. It's a bit hard when you're welded to the furniture.
1604 | 4065 | 4064 | I'm afraid we don't do product placement on this ship.
1605 | 4061 | 4060 | If you're a music fan, maybe you should try and introduce a little harmony into the music room.
1606 | 4073 | 4072 | Very impressive dear. Do you think you'll be able to navigate the ship?
1607 | 4041 | 4040 | I don't hold with all that science, dear. I prefer to believe complete nonsense. It's much more comforting, don't you think?
1608 | 4045 | 4044 | Oh, he's one of your clever-cloggies is he? I don't believe in straining the brain dear. Just wears it out.
1609 | 4029 | 4028 | I'm dawdling as quickly as I can.
1610 | 4049 | 4048 | Is that someone you met hanging round the water cooler?
1611 | 4053 | 4052 | You don't want to pay any attention to that book, dear, it's all made up. Complete fabrication.
1612 | 3749 | 3748 | my little raspberry souffl$.
1613 | 3299 | 3298 | Right away.
1614 | 3463 | 3462 | Right away.
1615 | 3235 | 3234 | Scraliontis.
1616 | 3611 | 3610 | Second Class.
1617 | 3167 | 3166 | Harrrr...
1618 | 3183 | 3182 | Atchoo...
1619 | 3187 | 3186 | Atchoo...
1620 | 3853 | 3852 | So what?
1621 | 3467 | 3466 | Soon.
1622 | 3519 | 3518 | Sorry?
1623 | 3523 | 3522 | Speak up.
1624 | 3527 | 3526 | Could you repeat that please, I didn't hear you.
1625 | 3531 | 3530 | Huh?.
1626 | 3535 | 3534 | Space, the final frontier.
1627 | 3777 | 3776 | sugarplum.
1628 | 3755 | 3754 | my little sunflower seed.
1629 | 3793 | 3792 | Sure.
1630 | 3797 | 3796 | Sure thing.
1631 | 3725 | 3724 | sweetheart.
1632 | 3727 | 3726 | sweetie.
1633 | 3729 | 3728 | sweetiepie.
1634 | 3283 | 3282 | I hear that thing is a bomb! Do be careful, dear!
1635 | 3917 | 3916 | I'm sure you can, lovey-dovey.
1636 | 3047 | 3046 | Whoops! There go my settings again!
1637 | 2837 | 2836 | Oh dear, dear, I'm so sorry.
1638 | 3563 | 3562 | Perhaps it has blown a fuse?
1639 | 2817 | 2816 | I'm fine dear. How are you?
1640 | 3925 | 3924 | It's very easy, you just pull the levers on the cellpoints.
1641 | 3383 | 3382 | You'll have to help her get her head together.
1642 | 2935 | 2934 | Just ask a LiftBot, dear.
1643 | 2979 | 2978 | Very lost, dear.
1644 | 3599 | 3598 | As young as spring time.
1645 | 4005 | 4004 | Well, if you think that's wise, dear.
1646 | 2829 | 2828 | Good!
1647 | 2875 | 2874 | Fascinating, dear.
1648 | 3087 | 3086 | Not that I know of. Have you tried any of the recreation rooms?
1649 | 2883 | 2882 | I probably shouldn't say, dear. I ought to be discreet.
1650 | 2891 | 2890 | Well, then a while later Leovinus himself came aboard. After that, though I heard lots of coming and goings, I didn't see anything more. That's all dear, I'm afraid.
1651 | 3629 | 3628 | The Maitre D is a charming man, but he has a weakness.
1652 | 2845 | 2844 | And you.
1653 | 4033 | 4032 | Now I'm sure you don't mean that dear.
1654 | 3095 | 3094 | Did you find that
1655 | 3103 | 3102 | you were looking for earlier?
1656 | 3143 | 3142 | Ah, I see you found that thing you were after.
1657 | 3151 | 3150 | Ah, I see you found that
1658 | 3159 | 3158 | you were after.
1659 | 2943 | 2942 | That's the BellBot's job, dear.
1660 | 3023 | 3022 | I have to stay here, dear. I'm welded down.
1661 | 3075 | 3074 | Yes, dear.
1662 | 3647 | 3646 | I've assigned you to a First Class Stateroom,
1663 | 3649 | 3648 | which you will reach by
1664 | 3651 | 3650 | You now have access to the Restaurant, the Canal and the Arboretum. Enjoy!
1665 | 3909 | 3908 | They are the personality parameters for each of the Bots, cherub.
1666 | 3067 | 3066 | My niceness is set to high and my gossipiness is set to low, dear.
1667 | 2995 | 2994 | Grieve, dear.
1668 | 3583 | 3582 | It's a kind of elevator only more complicated.
1669 | 2853 | 2852 | I am the DeskBot, dear.
1670 | 3619 | 3618 | He just likes to be of service, dear.
1671 | 3987 | 3986 | Oh, I don't know. I think you'll have to ask them yourself, dear.
1672 | 3995 | 3994 | I don't think it has any.
1673 | 2987 | 2986 | She's lost her mind, dear. Or it's been lost for her. Or misplaced.
1674 | 3893 | 3892 | Niceness and gossipiness, dear.
1675 | 3901 | 3900 | My niceness is high and my gossipiness is low, dear.
1676 | 3207 | 3206 | You mean the desk?
1677 | 3215 | 3214 | You mean the door?
1678 | 3191 | 3190 | You mean the Succ-U-Bus?
1679 | 3199 | 3198 | You mean the wall?
1680 | 3661 | 3660 | This is the Embarkation Lobby, dear.
1681 | 3933 | 3932 | They're in the Sculpture Chamber, dear heart.
1682 | 2895 | 2894 | Blerontis, dear.
1683 | 3669 | 3668 | I'll just call him for you, dear. Oh Krage!
1684 | 2971 | 2970 | Behind us, dear.
1685 | 3677 | 3676 | I'll just call him for you, dear. Oh Fentible!
1686 | 3695 | 3694 | At the Top of the Well, dear.
1687 | 2963 | 2962 | We were heading for Vastan. Now we're lost.
1688 | 3007 | 3006 | We haven't got any passengers.
1689 | 3015 | 3014 | The BarBot's in the Bar.
1690 | 3685 | 3684 | Nobby is in four of the elevators, dear.
1691 | 2951 | 2950 | I don't think you'll be needing that, dear, not here.
1692 | 2959 | 2958 | Then wait till you get back to your own world, dear.
1693 | 3035 | 3034 | Leovinus.
1694 | 3707 | 3706 | To reflect your enhanced status, my sweetheart.
1695 | 3331 | 3330 | Thank you.
1696 | 3335 | 3334 | All in a day's work.
1697 | 3339 | 3338 | My pleasure.
1698 | 3343 | 3342 | Glad to help.
1699 | 3347 | 3346 | If there's anything else I can do to help, please don't hesitate to ask.
1700 | 3239 | 3238 | The Gat.
1701 | 3825 | 3824 | Well, there you go.
1702 | 3131 | 3130 | thing
1703 | 3615 | 3614 | Super Galactic Traveler Class.
1704 | 3223 | 3222 | Titania.
1705 | 3495 | 3494 | Try the bar.
1706 | 3491 | 3490 | Try the Restaurant.
1707 | 3785 | 3784 | Uh huh.
1708 | 3171 | 3170 | Ummm...
1709 | 3351 | 3350 | Up and down.
1710 | 3323 | 3322 | We're already there.
1711 | 3059 | 3058 | They control my mood dear. The DoorBot knows more about how it works than I do.
1712 | 3367 | 3366 | Oh, things.
1713 | 3031 | 3030 | A wall.
1714 | 3539 | 3538 | You'll need to use your code to find your stateroom. You can also drag codes from your PET to tell the Succ-U-Bus where to send something, or to tell an Elevator or Pellerator where to take you.
1715 | 3083 | 3082 | This is where you check in, dear. Anything else to do with your room, I can take care of. Or try to.
1716 | 3703 | 3702 | Well, you can go and visit your room, you can explore the ship. But we'd really like it if you could help us figure out what is wrong with the ship. If there's anyway that the DoorBot or the BellBot can help you, you only have to summon them.
1717 | 3801 | 3800 | So what's new?
1718 | 3055 | 3054 | My Cellpoint settings.
1719 | 3371 | 3370 | Some stuff I had to do.
1720 | 3861 | 3860 | Whatever.
1721 | 3781 | 3780 | Whatever you like, dear.
1722 | 3447 | 3446 | It's high time you got a move on..
1723 | 3451 | 3450 | It's 'now'. You'd better hurry before it's 'too late'.
1724 | 3487 | 3486 | Whenever you like.
1725 | 3571 | 3570 | I don't know. Perhaps you should look for a fuse box?
1726 | 2903 | 2902 | It's recorded in your PET.
1727 | 2911 | 2910 | I'm sure you'll be very happy there.
1728 | 2909 | 2908 | via
1729 | 3939 | 3938 | Go out of here
1730 | 3943 | 3942 | turn left
1731 | 3947 | 3946 | turn right
1732 | 3951 | 3950 | past the Top of the Well
1733 | 3955 | 3954 | past the Top of the Well and you'll find it on your left
1734 | 3959 | 3958 | past the Top of the Well and you'll find it on your right
1735 | 3963 | 3962 | It's funny dear, that's exactly what dear Mr. Leovinus asked me when he came on board last night. No it wasn't - he said, or shouted, 'Where's the Ballroom?' which is odd, because I don't think we've got one, and he really got very agitated and said he'd designed a beautiful ballroom and all he found was a big empty hall with a blasted parrot in it and he hated parrots, and... well anyway I mustn't gossip must I? Turn left out of here and go past the Top of the Well and you'll soon find it.
1736 | 3967 | 3966 | straight ahead

1739 | 3977 | 3976 | You go out of here, straight ahead, turn left, past the Top of the Well, and you'll find it on your left.
1740 | 3355 | 3354 | Round and about.
1741 | 3359 | 3358 | Here and there.
1742 | 3363 | 3362 | This and that.
1743 | 3043 | 3042 | Starlight Lines dear.
1744 | 4011 | 4010 | Do you know I won an award once? Employee of the month, dear. What a month that was. You can just imagine!
1745 | 3763 | 3762 | my great big woolly bear.
1746 | 3247 | 3246 | You.
1747 | 3813 | 3812 | So, you're all set.
1748 | 3857 | 3856 | You got it.
1749 | 3591 | 3590 | Yes.
1750 | 3595 | 3594 | No.
1751 | 3327 | 3326 | You're standing in it.
1752 | 4387 | 4386 | You know what I think? I think the answer's in the email.
1753 | 4369 | 4368 | Aren't we all?
1754 | 4361 | 4360 | Ask the BellBot, why don't you?
1755 | 4363 | 4362 | Ask the DoorBot, why don't you?
1756 | 4425 | 4424 | I am having an off day.
1757 | 4427 | 4426 | It's my favourite mood, don't you like it?
1758 | 4429 | 4428 | Years of practise.
1759 | 4391 | 4390 | Because I like it.
1760 | 4379 | 4378 | I bet Brobostigon could tell you that. But he's been strangely silent since last night.
1761 | 4395 | 4394 | You got complaints, don't bring 'em to me.
1762 | 4435 | 4434 | We had some yesterday and I expect we'll have some tomorrow. But today? No.
1763 | 4403 | 4402 | Do you have the magazine?
1764 | 4151 | 4150 | See, you don't need my help.
1765 | 4421 | 4420 | When I feel like it.
1766 | 4423 | 4422 | Make me want to help you and I might.
1767 | 4437 | 4436 | I wouldn't give a dustman my garbage in this mood.
1768 | 4171 | 4170 | I think we'd get on faster if you asked me questions I would know the answer to.
1769 | 4417 | 4416 | Give me your in-flight magazine.
1770 | 4405 | 4404 | Ok, hand it over.
1771 | 4407 | 4406 | Hand it over immediately.
1772 | 4409 | 4408 | Did you get the lucky number? Show me your magazine.
1773 | 4153 | 4152 | How should I know?
1774 | 4373 | 4372 | Human error, get it? Human error.
1775 | 4175 | 4174 | I don't know.
1776 | 4399 | 4398 | Do let me see.
1777 | 4107 | 4106 | Bed - Imperial? Royal? Presidential? Despotic?
1778 | 4115 | 4114 | Benevolent or Dictatorial?
1779 | 4117 | 4116 | Ah yes, that's the most spacious one we offer.
1780 | 4111 | 4110 | King Size? Queen Size? Prince? Princess? Princess plus?
1781 | 4113 | 4112 | Constitutional or Absolute?
1782 | 4109 | 4108 | Which - Imperial? Royal? Presidential? Despotic?
1783 | 4119 | 4118 | Hmm, good choice. Now - yellow?
1784 | 4123 | 4122 | Come on, only you know - Yes or no?
1785 | 4121 | 4120 | Hmmm, not what I would have guessed.
1786 | 4137 | 4136 | Good! Well you certainly won't like the room you've got then.
1787 | 4139 | 4138 | You've been assigned to Super Galactic Traveller Class.
1788 | 4141 | 4140 | And don't come whining to me for upgrades because you won't get one! Krage!
1789 | 4101 | 4100 | Corner or balcony?
1790 | 4103 | 4102 | Good choice.
1791 | 4105 | 4104 | Come on, only you know - Which?
1792 | 4125 | 4124 | Fish?
1793 | 4127 | 4126 | Fish?
1794 | 4129 | 4128 | Fish?
1795 | 4133 | 4132 | Come on, only you know - Yes or no?
1796 | 4131 | 4130 | Separate or Ensuite?
1797 | 4077 | 4076 | I'm asking the questions. Now -
1798 | 4079 | 4078 | I'm asking the questions.
1799 | 4089 | 4088 | Newspaper - The Blerontin Bugle? the Trumpet? Saxophone? Kazoo?
1800 | 4091 | 4090 | Ok.
1801 | 4093 | 4092 | Which? The Blerontin Bugle? the Trumpet? Saxophone? Kazoo?
1802 | 4135 | 4134 | Come on, only you know.
1803 | 4095 | 4094 | How do you like your room - with a view?
1804 | 4097 | 4096 | Ok.
1805 | 4099 | 4098 | Come on, only you know - Yes or no?
1806 | 4081 | 4080 | Better get you checked in. What sort of breakfast would you like in the morning -Continental or the full porky?
1807 | 4087 | 4086 | Good choice.
1808 | 4085 | 4084 | Whatever you say.
1809 | 4083 | 4082 | Which? Continental or the full porky?
1810 | 4359 | 4358 | Mhhhhhhhno. I just can't get off this desk.
1811 | 4149 | 4148 | See, you didn't need to ask me.
1812 | 4147 | 4146 | It wasn't really a question, I was just passing the time.
1813 | 4145 | 4144 | Don't you know a rhetorical question when you hear one.
1814 | 4375 | 4374 | You really want to know what I think? I think sabotage. But you didn't hear it from me.
1815 | 4381 | 4380 | You know who I think knows more about that than he should? Scraliontis, that's who. And where is he now? That's what I'd like to know.
1816 | 4165 | 4164 | Hey, I should be an analyst, shouldn't I? Earn a lot more more money than sitting here like a desklamp or as a desklamp.
1817 | 4187 | 4186 | It takes one to know one.
1818 | 4189 | 4188 | Because that's just the way I am.
1819 | 4383 | 4382 | You know, those three used to communicate a lot by email. I bet it's all in the ship's system somewhere.
1820 | 4413 | 4412 | Only if you are a winner.
1821 | 4393 | 4392 | That's the way I am. Take it or leave it.
1822 | 4163 | 4162 | What do you think?
1823 | 4431 | 4430 | Use the service elevator.
1824 | 4433 | 4432 | Over there, stupid!
1825 | 4157 | 4156 | Where do you think?
1826 | 4161 | 4160 | Who do you think?
1827 | 4143 | 4142 | So, who's asking?
1828 | 4159 | 4158 | Why do you think?
1829 | 4155 | 4154 | Why should I care?
1830 | 4323 | 4322 | 43

1848 | 4389 | 4388 | You know what I think? I think the answer's in the email.
1849 | 4181 | 4180 | You're beginning to give me a complex, dear. All the stuff I learnt at answering school and you won't ask me any of it.
1850 | 4371 | 4370 | Aren't we all, dear?
1851 | 4397 | 4396 | I am so sorry, but there is nothing I can do.

1901 | 4177 | 4176 | I don't know, dear.
1902 | 4183 | 4182 | A kind of elevator.
1903 | 4185 | 4184 | A kind of lift.
1904 | 4401 | 4400 | Do let me see.
1905 | 4365 | 4364 | I'd like to help but it's beyond me. You might do better to ask the BellBot.
1906 | 4367 | 4366 | I'd like to help but it's beyond me. You might do better to ask the DoorBot.
1907 | 4167 | 4166 | Nice of you to ask, dear.
1908 | 4169 | 4168 | I've no idea but it's nice of you to ask.
1909 | 4179 | 4178 | See, there is another. Rack rack rack goes my little brain but nothing comes.

1928 | 4377 | 4376 | You really want to know what I think, dear? I think sabotage. But you didn't hear it from me.
1929 | 4385 | 4384 | You know, those three used to communicate a lot by email. I bet it's all in the ship's system somewhere.
1930 | 4415 | 4414 | Only if you are a winner.
1931 | 4319 | 4318 | via
1932 | 4321 | 4320 | which you can reach by
1933 | 163 | 162 | You're being a little terse, dear.
1934 | 161 | 160 | I see the art of conversation just died.
1935 | 549 | 548 | You know what I dream of? Parrot death!
1936 | 551 | 550 | You know what I dream of? Parrots crashing in flames!
1937 | 569 | 568 | I'm absolutely certain that you misheard me.
1938 | 571 | 570 | Not me, dear, I didn't say that.
1939 | 553 | 552 | Is that the Parrot from hell? Or the Parrot that's going there?
1940 | 555 | 554 | I think it's beginning to get to you a bit. Why not listen to some music? I always find Boppy Headcase and his Laid-back Loafers are good to relax to in the music room.
1941 | 557 | 556 | I said that? I don't think so!
1942 | 559 | 558 | I never said any such thing.
1943 | 561 | 560 | I would never say such a thing.
1944 | 563 | 562 | Me? I didn't say a word.
1945 | 565 | 564 | Me? Say that? No!
1946 | 567 | 566 | I think you must have misheard me.
1947 | 199 | 198 | The BarBot! Malevolent old sot. Vicious mood swings. Vicious. I could go on...
1948 | 201 | 200 | Half the time what he tells you is a complete lie! I could go on...
1949 | 203 | 202 | I bet he knows more than he's telling. I know that those two, I mean Brobostigon and Scraliontis went to his bar last night. I'd like to know what went on there! I could go on...
1950 | 175 | 174 | I used to think he was an airhead. Now I'm not so sure. I could go on.
1951 | 177 | 176 | Now I think it's just a total vacuum up there. I could say more...
1952 | 179 | 178 | Snooping interfering. I don't trust him. I could say more...
1953 | 239 | 238 | Brobostigon. Typical man. All nice when he should be tough. I could go on...
1954 | 241 | 240 | In the end things get so bad he can't deal with it. And you know what happens then? I could go on...
1955 | 243 | 242 | Lies. Deceit. Just so everything could be nice. I could go on...
1956 | 535 | 534 | Byzantine numismatics? Don't talk to me about Byzantine numismatics. I've had it up to here with Byzantine numismatics! You can hardly move in this place without people going on about Byzantine Numismatics!
1957 | 461 | 460 | The sheer effrontery! The sheer barefaced nerve! You've got one of the finest staterooms that luxury travel can offer, for free, and you WANT ANOTHER ONE! Go and boil your buttocks!
1958 | 463 | 462 | No no no no no no no no no no no no no no!
1959 | 465 | 464 | And another one for luck! No!
1960 | 453 | 452 | Cherries? Won't have anything to do with cherries. Bring me out in a rash. Rust. Whatever. And don't listen to what that BarBot tells you! He's a malevolent old sot!
1961 | 481 | 480 | At least a self respecting rock star would have the courtesy to crush his own television set. You are not merely insane and importunate. You are also lazy!
1962 | 293 | 292 | Stupid old fool. I could say more.
1963 | 295 | 294 | He's supposed to be a safe pair of hands. But no pair of hands is totally safe unless it's got at least a rudimentary kind of mind in charge. I could say more.
1964 | 297 | 296 | And that superior manner? Who's he supposed to be superior to? I could say more...
1965 | 225 | 224 | Leovinus is a fool. A very clever and ingenious fool, but all the bigger fool for that. I could go on.....
1966 | 227 | 226 | Not as young as he was, of course. Not as spry. Came to rely on technology instead of his own eyes. If he'd come and seen for himself instead of using all that telepresence gimmickry he would have seen what THEY were doing to his ship. I could go on...
1967 | 229 | 228 | Brobostigon and Scraliontis is who I mean, of course. Running rings around him. Nice as pie to his face of course. Mr. Leovinus this, Mr. Leovinus that. But behind his back... well, you can see the state the ship is in. I could say more...
1968 | 231 | 230 | And then there's Titania, of course. You want to see a real idiot? See an idiot in love. I could say more...
1969 | 187 | 186 | Stupid old fool. Going on about the war the whole time. Which war? That's what I want to know. Damned if I know. Damned if he knows. I could go on...
1970 | 189 | 188 | Galactic War 5 could break out in his elevator and he wouldn't notice. Still be dreaming about the last one. I could go on...
1971 | 191 | 190 | But something did happen in his elevator. Oh yes, something certainly happened. I could go on...
1972 | 211 | 210 | The Maitre d'Bot! Talk about affected! Talk about a poseur! Used to drive Mr. Leovinus mad with his simpering. I could go on...
1973 | 213 | 212 | Wouldn't surprise me if Mr. Leovinus really lost his temper with him one day. I could say more...
1974 | 215 | 214 | In fact it wouldn't surprise me if some of the strange noises I heard last night weren't exactly that! I could go on...
1975 | 375 | 374 | Well go and get some then! Go and make a hit record! Go and build a vast financial empire in the petro-chemical industry! Go and marry someone with more money than God! Go and rob a bank!
1976 | 377 | 376 | Exactly! And that's why you don't travel first class!
1977 | 273 | 272 | I hate that parrot. I could say more.
1978 | 275 | 274 | I'm not the type to pass on gossip, but I think that the presence of that parrot on board this ship has a lot to do with what's gone wrong with it. I could say more.
1979 | 277 | 276 | I'm not the type to pass on gossip, but I think that whoever put that parrot on board was up to something. I could go on.
1980 | 279 | 278 | I'm not the type to pass on gossip - well, I am actually - but it's a well known fact that Leovinus hated parrots. I could say more.
1981 | 493 | 492 | Why don't you go and pur$e the Parrot instead? Now that would be a service to the community.
1982 | 317 | 316 | Wretched noise that stupid RowBot makes. All that fruity warbling, can't bear it. I wish someone would make him stop for a bit. I could go on...
1983 | 319 | 318 | You could probably manage it if you wanted to... I could go on.
1984 | 321 | 320 | All it would probably take would be a spare pair of hands. I could go on.
1985 | 251 | 250 | Scraliontis is a crook! There, I've said it. I could say more...
1986 | 253 | 252 | Never trust an accountant! An accountant is someone who when you're drowning throws you a lead lifebelt. And charges for it! If he had done his sums properly to begin with none of this would have happened! I could go on...
1987 | 255 | 254 | All he wanted to do was save his own skin! Provided he was safe everyone else could go to hell on a toboggan! Dreamy Leovinus, and even that stupid fool Brobostigon! I could go on...
1988 | 299 | 298 | Foulmouthed flatulent windpipe! I could say more...
1989 | 301 | 300 | It's disgusting having one of those things sitting leering and burping in every single room in this ship! I could say more...
1990 | 303 | 302 | There's something very strange about the way he's been sounding though. I think he's got something stuck somewhere. I could say more...
1991 | 265 | 264 | Little cybertart. Or big cybertart! Don't let those grand statues fool you. It's what you're like inside that matters, and she was just playing him along! I could say more...
1992 | 267 | 266 | Unhealthy, that's what I call it! An obsession! I could say more...
1993 | 269 | 268 | I know she was programmed to love him, so she had to, of course, but she didn't have to encourage him! I could go on...
1994 | 271 | 270 | No wonder he went mad when she lost her mind! She wasn't the only one who went all to pieces! I could go on...
1995 | 395 | 394 | You can use it to control the Succ-U-Bus. I could go on.
1996 | 399 | 398 | And you can use it to control the ship's Tvs. I could go on.
1997 | 403 | 402 | Oh, work it out for yourself.
1998 | 323 | 322 | Mayhem. That's what. Skullduggery and mayhem. It should have no place in a beautiful ship like this. But then I'm just the DeskBot.
1999 | 367 | 366 | Upgrade? You loathsome little ligger! What's so startlingly incomprehensible about the idea of buying an actual ticket! With actual money!
2000 | 369 | 368 | Upgrade? You toadying little creep! Buy a ticket! It'll only cost an arm and a leg and another leg and your head and about fifteen sixteenths of your ribcage! Of course it will hurt! It's meant to!
2001 | 371 | 370 | Upgrade? Upgrade? This is a very, very, very, very, very expensive cruise liner! Not a charitable institution for freeloaders!
2002 | 373 | 372 | Just look at this lobby! It is very, very, very, very shiny! Shiny means expensive! Expensive means money! Lots of it! You want to stand around in nice shiny lobbies you HAVE TO PAY!
2003 | 67 | 66 | One, I handle all reservations and registrations. Two, I manage passengers relations. Three I keep an eye out for freeloaders. But most importantly, Four, I HATE THAT PARROT!!! I could say more.
2004 | 499 | 498 | Go and look for it yourself.
2005 | 59 | 58 | I'm the DeskBot. The name's Drewbish. Marsinta Drewbish. You can call me DeskBot. I take a very dim view of freeloaders, and I'm taking a very dim view of one now.
2006 | 353 | 352 | Very well, be like that.
2007 | 29 | 28 | And who might you be?
2008 | 343 | 342 | I seem to remember we've given you a free room already! Think yourself lucky!
2009 | 345 | 344 | I have no time for freeloaders!
2010 | 1 | 0 | But I won't!
2011 | 3 | 2 | I have better things to do!
2012 | 5 | 4 | You think I've got nothing better to do than gossip!
2013 | 7 | 6 | Do I look as if I'm configured to gossip? I'm not!
2014 | 9 | 8 | It's not in my current set up to gossip! Stop it!
2015 | 151 | 150 | But I won't.
2016 | 533 | 532 | Byzantine numismatics? Don't make me laugh!
2017 | 459 | 458 | Well you can't!
2018 | 451 | 450 | Cherries? Won't have anything to do with cherries.
2019 | 479 | 478 | Do I look like a purveyor of bizarre junk to freeloaders? No! Go away!
2020 | 97 | 96 | Hmmm, clearly not. Never mind, we'll struggle on. Now, come again?
2021 | 105 | 104 | Hmmm... I see irony's lost on you as well.
2022 | 349 | 348 | Let me see that!
2023 | 351 | 350 | That's your new stateroom. Second class and better than you deserve. Just don't try it again.
2024 | 379 | 378 | Well, tough!
2025 | 381 | 380 | Extraordinary! Do you think we might have hit on the reason why you're not travelling first class?
2026 | 491 | 490 | Oh grow up!
2027 | 341 | 340 | Oh yes? And whose budget was that supposed to come out of?
2028 | 347 | 346 | Oh yes? And whose budget was that supposed to come out of?
2029 | 355 | 354 | Upgrade you? You've got to be joking!
2030 | 357 | 356 | Upgrade you? I'd rather be dead in a ditch!
2031 | 359 | 358 | Upgrade you? I'd rather saw my own head off!
2032 | 361 | 360 | Upgrade you? I'd rather be melted down and made into a toast rack!
2033 | 363 | 362 | Upgrade you? I'd rather be sandwiched between a yak's buttocks!
2034 | 365 | 364 | Upgrade you? I'd rather spend an evening ... with the Parrot!
2035 | 65 | 64 | This.
2036 | 501 | 500 | You think I care where the promenade deck is? You think I go promenading in my spare time? I'm a desk lamp, not a heron.
2037 | 57 | 56 | I'm the DeskBot.
2038 | 145 | 144 | No!
2039 | 437 | 436 | I am TRYING to get some rest!
2040 | 439 | 438 | Go away! Whatever you're doing, stop it!
2041 | 441 | 440 | If it takes three men with five shovels seven days to dig nine holes, how long would it take a goat? Quickly now, I've got to hurry you. Wrong!
2042 | 443 | 442 | Fish? Fish? Fish? Fish? Fish? Fish?
2043 | 445 | 444 | I'm not going mad! I'm not! In spite of all this provocation I'm not going mad!
2044 | 447 | 446 | Do you want a paper in the morning? Do you want a paper in the morning? Do you want a paper in the morning? Arrggh!
2045 | 37 | 36 | Oh. Pity.
2046 | 39 | 38 | Yes, well I'm sure that one of the bolts on the ship's keel suffered a slight scratch to its paintwork that was a lot more expensive, so I wouldn't go on about it if I were you.
2047 | 41 | 40 | You're getting a free trip so I really wouldn't go on about it.
2048 | 43 | 42 | Relax. Enjoy.
2049 | 45 | 44 | I have a very simple way of dealing with people like you.
2050 | 31 | 30 | Ah yes, we've been expecting you. We've taken the precaution of having all frogs removed from the ship.
2051 | 33 | 32 | Is that some kind of name or what is that?
2052 | 53 | 52 | I thought not. Well, much as it goes against the grain I understand that in the circumstances we can offer you a complimentary berth in Super Galactic Traveler Class.
2053 | 55 | 54 | Well that's as may be. Do you have a reservation?
2054 | 35 | 34 | A passenger? Are you sure? Dressed like that?
2055 | 47 | 46 | I bet our lawyers are bigger than yours. Now, what do you want?
2056 | 93 | 92 | Haven't got time for that. Busy busy busy! Any problems with your room bring them to me and I'll ignore them as soon as I can. Anything else I can ignore straight away.
2057 | 95 | 94 | Haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about. Do you speak Blerontian?
2058 | 157 | 156 | Nobody likes a smartass!
2059 | 545 | 544 | YOU want to complain about the Parrot? How do you think I feel? I have to live with that scrofulous hookbeaked devil bird of sin!
2060 | 107 | 106 | Hoot gibber! Hoot gibber! I haven't got time for this.
2061 | 109 | 108 | I'm not going to talk to you until you at least try to talk sense.
2062 | 111 | 110 | I said I'm not going to talk to you until you at least try to talk sense.
2063 | 113 | 112 | No, still complete nonsense.
2064 | 115 | 114 | I'm just going to say 'banana' until you talk sense.
2065 | 117 | 116 | Banana! Banana! Banana!
2066 | 99 | 98 | You're not from the planet Gibber are you? Our autotranslators often have trouble with Gibberish.
2067 | 101 | 100 | Hooo Hooo Hooo! Eee! Eee! Is that what you're trying to convey?
2068 | 103 | 102 | Any other languages? Gobbledygook? Balderdash? I can manage a smattering of Drivel...
2069 | 331 | 330 | If only that were true.
2070 | 541 | 540 | It's VERY NICE. It may be a little bit small, but even something very small is almost infinitely bigger than nothing at all which is what you paid for it!
2071 | 413 | 412 | In your dreams!
2072 | 415 | 414 | In your dreams!
2073 | 515 | 514 | Go and fry your face.
2074 | 517 | 516 | Go and grill your nipples.
2075 | 417 | 416 | In your dreams!
2076 | 419 | 418 | In your dreams!
2077 | 421 | 420 | YOU THINK I'M GOING TO SAYING ANYTHING OTHER THAN 'IN YOUR DREAMS' DON'T YOU... IN YOUR DREAMS.
2078 | 505 | 504 | And the same to you!
2079 | 507 | 506 | Talk like that will get you nowhere!
2080 | 509 | 508 | Please!
2081 | 511 | 510 | Really!
2082 | 513 | 512 | That's quite enough of that, thank you.
2083 | 165 | 164 | Doesn't cost much to be polite.
2084 | 153 | 152 | Ok.
2085 | 431 | 430 | What's 'this'? Oh that! Give that to me.
2086 | 433 | 432 | I don't know what you're talking about and frankly I don't care.
2087 | 435 | 434 | I've got more important things to do than sit around talking to you all day.
2088 | 393 | 392 | Your PERSONAL ELECTRONIC THING! No passenger should be without it! I could go on...
2089 | 147 | 146 | He's the tall shiny thing over there. Looks like a standard lamp but without the intelligence. I could go on.
2090 | 149 | 148 | He's still the tall shiny thing over there. I could go on.
2091 | 73 | 72 | Now what!?
2092 | 75 | 74 | You again! You're being extremely importunate.
2093 | 77 | 76 | What is it this time? This is intolerable!
2094 | 79 | 78 | Read my lips! No upgrades!
2095 | 11 | 10 | None of your business! My set up is between me and my engineer.
2096 | 13 | 12 | My configuration is a perfect work of art and not to be tampered with!
2097 | 15 | 14 | This is gross invasion of my privacy and I'm going to keep on saying so until you stop talking about it!
2098 | 51 | 50 | Hmmm. This is obviously some dreadful backwater we've drifted into. Do you have a reservation?
2099 | 81 | 80 | Nobody likes a smartass!
2100 | 83 | 82 | Why don't you go and play one of those games where you get disemboweled?
2101 | 477 | 476 | Well, just keep going up, dear, and I'm sure you'll get there.
2102 | 71 | 70 | I look after all reservations and registrations, I look after my passengers, and also, if you'll excuse me for a moment... I HATE THAT PARROT! I could say more.
2103 | 193 | 192 | That BarBot has more charm than is good for a person. Pity he's got into such a rut. I could say more.
2104 | 195 | 194 | Well, when I say rut, it's more like a loop. He takes everything literally of course, like all those of the Blarghish race. Once he gets hold of an idea he won't let go. I could go on.
2105 | 197 | 196 | But there's nothing he wouldn't do for a person when he's not talking. Or bawling you out. Or getting stuck in a loop. I could say more...
2106 | 169 | 168 | Such a nice, young, lampstandy kind of bot . A little unreliable, sometimes, but ... I could say more.
2107 | 171 | 170 | He just needs a bit of artful sorting out. I could say more...
2108 | 173 | 172 | His eyes are everywhere. You want to know what's going on, you ask the BellBot. I could go on...
2109 | 233 | 232 | Brobostigon. Such a nice man. Cuddly. Jolly. Wanted everything to be nice, everyone to be happy. I could go on...
2110 | 235 | 234 | So of course, when things started to go wrong, he still wanted everyone to be happy... I could go on...
2111 | 237 | 236 | Poor Brobostigon. In the end he just couldn't handle things. Events just swallowed him up... I could go on...
2112 | 539 | 538 | I'm not very good at Byzantine numismatics I'm afraid, dear. I mean I've tried but I keep on getting in a muddle with the different denominations.
2113 | 475 | 474 | There you are, dear, I've moved you up a whole floor.
2114 | 473 | 472 | Fancy a bit of a change do you dear? I know, even those big rooms can get a bit stuffy after a while, can't they? Give me your PET.
2115 | 457 | 456 | Ah, you've been talking to the BarBot again, haven't you? He's a naughty old BarBot, and he knows perfectly well that cherries don't agree with me. And I don't agree with cherries either for that matter. Many's the time I've sat up late arguing with cherries about just about anything. Bicker bicker bicker. In my youth, dear, in my youth.
2116 | 489 | 488 | I'd like to help, dear, you know I would, but I have to say that your requests are becoming a little bit bizarre. Perhaps you should get some rest? Why not relax to the easy sounds of Boppy Headcase and his Laid-back Loafers in the music room?
2117 | 281 | 280 | He's a nice old boy when he's got his wits around him. I could say more.
2118 | 283 | 282 | He suffers from mood swings. One moment he's quite cheerful, next he's gloomy as sin. I could say more.
2119 | 285 | 284 | And his memory! Sometimes it's fine, but other times he can hardly remember which way up is Wednesday. I could say more...
2120 | 287 | 286 | But I mustn't.
2121 | 289 | 288 | No really I mustn't.
2122 | 291 | 290 | I've said more than I should!
2123 | 217 | 216 | Leovinus! Such a man! One of the most celebrated men in the galaxy of course! I could go on...
2124 | 219 | 218 | Architect! Engineer! Artist! This ship was a dream for him! A vision. But that's the trouble with visionaries, of course. I could go on...
2125 | 221 | 220 | Their heads are so full of visions that they often don't see what's really happening! And then of course, there's the small matter of the heart! I could go on...
2126 | 223 | 222 | Men who are giants in matters of the intellect are often small boys in matters of the heart. Ahh... Titania! I could go on.
2127 | 181 | 180 | The others think he's a bore, but I think he's a bit of a honey. I could go on.
2128 | 183 | 182 | There's a rumor going round that he's lost his head. I could go on...
2129 | 185 | 184 | Luckily he's got three more, if you see what I mean. I could go on...
2130 | 205 | 204 | Such a charming man! Passionate! Romantic! A little volatile, of course. I could go on...
2131 | 207 | 206 | Takes his job terribly seriously of course, so you must be very careful that you don't upset him! I could go on...
2132 | 209 | 208 | If you have to deal with the Maitre d'Bot, you should speak softly and carry a long stick! I could go on...
2133 | 385 | 384 | I know how you feel, dear. I know how you feel!
2134 | 497 | 496 | Oh dear, I never heard of such a thing! I know that there are some starlings up on the promenade deck, but they are such nice twittering little birdies, I really wouldn't like to see them put in a blender.
2135 | 311 | 310 | I like a man with a lovely voice. I could go on...
2136 | 313 | 312 | Of course, he's been sounding a little odd today. I could say more...
2137 | 315 | 314 | Do you think something might have affected his vocal chambers? I could go on...
2138 | 245 | 244 | Such a clever man, Scraliontis. All those figures. Very clever. I could go on...
2139 | 247 | 246 | Of course, all that adding up can turn a man's mind can't it? It's a proven scientific fact. I could go on ...
2140 | 249 | 248 | I'm sure he was a nice little boy. It's just a pity he had to grow up and do all those sums. I could go on...
2141 | 305 | 304 | He's a friendly enough fellow, in his rudimentary way. Simple but straight. More than you can say for some of the people around here! I could say more...
2142 | 307 | 306 | It's nice to have someone around the place. Even with all those nasty farting noises. I could say more...
2143 | 309 | 308 | It's the big one I blame. She could have taught him some manners, only she has none to teach. I could go on...
2144 | 257 | 256 | Titania! Oh Titania! Sweet cyberlife! The prettiest superintelligence you ever laid eyes on! I could say more...
2145 | 259 | 258 | She looks so stern and brooding in all these statues, but she followed the sweetest, prettiest algorithms! She quite turned his head. I could go on...
2146 | 261 | 260 | And she did love him. Oh, yes, she loved Leovinus all right. She couldn't help herself. He had programmed her to! I could say more...
2147 | 263 | 262 | She realised what they were up to, of course. That's why they did what they did! I could say more...
2148 | 397 | 396 | Well, for a start you can use it to control the Succ-U-Bus. I could go on.
2149 | 401 | 400 | And it's also very useful for controlling the ship's TVs. I could go on.
2150 | 405 | 404 | That's all for now. Whoops, I have to go.
2151 | 389 | 388 | Oh I don't see why not, dear. The rooms are all empty, aren't they? Pity to waste them, and you've had such a difficult time.
2152 | 391 | 390 | There you are dear. You deserve it.
2153 | 63 | 62 | I'm the DeskBot, dear. My name's Marsinta Drewbish, but you're welcome to call me Marsinta. I'm here to make sure everything's as lovely as possible on your voyage.
2154 | 17 | 16 | No, I mustn't.
2155 | 19 | 18 | I really mustn't...
2156 | 21 | 20 | Whoops! Got to go!
2157 | 23 | 22 | Well I shouldn't sit about talking...
2158 | 25 | 24 | I'm such a dreadful gossip...
2159 | 27 | 26 | Whoops! Got to go!
2160 | 69 | 68 | I fuss over my passengers, dear.
2161 | 537 | 536 | Byzantine numismatics, dear? Not one of my strengths I'm afraid.
2162 | 467 | 466 | Fancy a bit of a change do you dear? Give me your PET. Do you want to go to the left or the right?
2163 | 471 | 470 | Well, I don't know what you're talking about, as usual, dear, but there you are, I've moved you next door.
2164 | 469 | 468 | There you are, dear, I've moved you next door.
2165 | 455 | 454 | No, dear, I don't have any cherries.
2166 | 483 | 482 | Oh, I don't think we've got one of those dear, sorry. Not a crushed one.
2167 | 485 | 484 | I'm sorry dear, I'd like to oblige but we're fresh out.
2168 | 487 | 486 | I'm sorry dear, but we're so short staffed and the staff we've got are so shortbrained, there's not much I can do to help.
2169 | 135 | 134 | Oh dear, just my little joke, dear.
2170 | 335 | 334 | No, I mustn't.
2171 | 337 | 336 | I really mustn't...
2172 | 339 | 338 | Whoops! Got to go!
2173 | 383 | 382 | Neither have I, dear. That's why I'm squatting on this desk talking to you.
2174 | 495 | 494 | Oh dear! You'll give me a heart attack with your strange ideas!
2175 | 327 | 326 | In fact if you wanted my truthful opinion I think that all is not as it should be. I could go on...
2176 | 329 | 328 | I think this ship is in terrible trouble, dear. You might be wise to get off while you can. I could go on...
2177 | 411 | 410 | I hate that parrot!
2178 | 387 | 386 | Certainly dear. Anything else I can do for you?
2179 | 61 | 60 | I'm the DeskBot, dear.
2180 | 449 | 448 | I'm sorry dear, I don't think I'm available at the moment.
2181 | 49 | 48 | Well, that'll be nice for you. Unfortunately it will also be very nice for our lawyers, who are very, very expensive. Anything else I can help you with?
2182 | 119 | 118 | I'm sorry dear, that's a little off-topic for me. Anything else I can help you with? Room alright?
2183 | 125 | 124 | I really can't understand what you're trying to say, dear. You don't speak any Blerontian do you?
2184 | 159 | 158 | I think you're in the wrong universe, dear.
2185 | 547 | 546 | Oh, I know how you feel, dear, I know how you feel. What I wouldn't like to see happen to that parrot!
2186 | 137 | 136 | You're really not making sense at all dear. Are you feeling quite well?
2187 | 139 | 138 | I really think it would help if you'd at least try to make sense, dear.
2188 | 141 | 140 | Sorry, dear.
2189 | 143 | 142 | Any questions, ask the BellBot, unless it's about upgrades in which case you ask me, and I can tell you right now what the answer will be.
2190 | 127 | 126 | No, obviously not. Oh, well, we won't be downhearted. Now, come again?
2191 | 129 | 128 | Are you persevering bravely under some linguistic challenge, dear? I do applaud your effort but I don't really understand it.
2192 | 131 | 130 | Hooo Hooo Hooo! Eee! Eee! Is that what you're trying to say, dear?
2193 | 133 | 132 | Do you speak any other languages? Blither? A little Fiddlesticks perhaps? How's your Twaddle?
2194 | 333 | 332 | We're all a little bit lost, aren't we dear? I could go on.
2195 | 123 | 122 | Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to make things better?
2196 | 121 | 120 | Well that's the main thing isn't it? Good.
2197 | 423 | 422 | Not in my current condition, dear.
2198 | 425 | 424 | I'm a small folding desk lamp.
2199 | 531 | 530 | I'm sorry you feel like that, very sorry.
2200 | 427 | 426 | And don't leave any marks on our nice shiny floors!
2201 | 429 | 428 | And the same to you, I'm sure!
2202 | 519 | 518 | Oh dear, and I thought we were friends.
2203 | 521 | 520 | Oh, and just when we were getting on so well.
2204 | 523 | 522 | Now dear, are you sure that's the sort of thing you want to say?
2205 | 525 | 524 | I'm trying to help. Please try to be nice.
2206 | 527 | 526 | Oh dear, and manners cost so little.
2207 | 529 | 528 | It's the parents I blame.
2208 | 167 | 166 | That's alright, dear. We're all a little tense.
2209 | 155 | 154 | My pleasure. It's what I'm here for.
2210 | 325 | 324 | Well, I don't think everything's gone quite according to plan on this voyage. I could go on.
2211 | 85 | 84 | Hello dear!
2212 | 87 | 86 | Oh, there you are. Nice to see you again, dear.
2213 | 89 | 88 | Something I can help you with?
2214 | 91 | 90 | I wish I could upgrade you again, dear, but you're already first class!
2215 | 543 | 542 | Oh, dear, yes it is a little bit tiny isn't it? What would you like to do about it?
2216 | 407 | 406 | It's your PERSONAL ELECTRONIC THING. It will help you to do almost anything you need to do on the ship. I could go on.
2217 | 409 | 408 | BUT I MUSTN'T SIT HERE GOSSIPING!
2218 | 503 | 502 | It's best to ask the DoorBot or the BellBot that kind of thing, dear. They get around much more than I do.</deskbot>

142 | 3045 | 3044 | Did he?
143 | 3047 | 3046 | Did she?
144 | 3049 | 3048 | Did they?
145 | 3051 | 3050 | Just like you.

154 | 2291 | 2290 | She was a blonde-haired blue-lipped sweety pie - till she got hooked on yodeling and started using gas. She had talent and looks - and she threw it all away.

156 | 2295 | 2294 | Don't mention her to Fentible - his temperature goes up and he starts leaking brake fluid.
157 | 2343 | 2342 | Look dude. I'm a lifting-carrying-taking-doing kind of Bot. It's a waste of time talking ideas to me.
158 | 2345 | 2344 | Whatever you say. It's not my job to argue.
159 | 2347 | 2346 | Yea, well, like I said - it's a waste of time talking ideas to me.
160 | 2349 | 2348 | I'm not really very bright, am I?
161 | 2351 | 2350 | Well thanks a lot. I'm not going to help you get an upgrade.

169 | 3155 | 3154 | Ridden in it? I invented it.
170 | 3141 | 3140 | Nope. I'm a clean living bot.
171 | 3143 | 3142 | Like I said. I'm a clean living bot.
172 | 3111 | 3110 | Don't believe in 'em.
173 | 3071 | 3070 | If it moves I fancy it. I draw the line at two legs though.
174 | 3073 | 3072 | If it moves I dig it. I draw the line at two legs though.
175 | 3149 | 3148 | Don't watch films - too busy living.

178 | 1985 | 1984 | You want fries with that?
179 | 2275 | 2274 | For fun, what do you think?
180 | 1901 | 1900 | I'll come back when you're not such a wise-ass.
181 | 1903 | 1902 | We're not at home to mister rude.
182 | 1905 | 1904 | Just because I'm a bot there's no reason to treat me like one.
183 | 1907 | 1906 | I suppose you think I don't have feelings? Ha well I don't! Aren't I the luckiest thing in all creation.
184 | 2283 | 2282 | You never seen it? It's a bit like Through the Blackhole but with real trash planets.
185 | 2261 | 2260 | Crappiest cab company this side of Lurcher Minor.
186 | 2439 | 2438 | I don't know why you want to bring that up now man.
187 | 2441 | 2440 | Hey I just don't see the point of that right now.
188 | 2443 | 2442 | You know something? I'm getting really bored by some of the stuff you're coming out with.
189 | 2445 | 2444 | Very interesting and also completely useless right now.
190 | 2447 | 2446 | Yeah so what if you're right - there's other stuff going on you should be getting involved with.
191 | 2449 | 2448 | You are really wasting time dude - you better get your act together.
192 | 2451 | 2450 | You know there's other stuff you should be getting your head round right now.
193 | 2453 | 2452 | Call me a rude BellBot if you will - but you ought to open your mind a little you know.
194 | 2455 | 2454 | I'm sure that's really interesting to you - but right now I think you ought to be getting on with other things - OK?
195 | 1965 | 1964 | Are you CRAZY? I'm not allowed to take TIPS! WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME FOR?!
196 | 1967 | 1966 | They offered me a tip they offered me a tip they offered me a tip I'M IN A LOOP I'M IN A LOOP I'M IN A LOOP!
197 | 1969 | 1968 | Hey - I'll let you know when it's safe. Till then - don't mention tips.
198 | 1981 | 1980 | Have a nice day.
199 | 1983 | 1982 | Missing you already.
200 | 2265 | 2264 | It's a savory lo-cal spread - delicious on warm bagels. Are you nuts? You never seen bird crap before?
201 | 2271 | 2270 | Next to Gzyklon Major, where do you think?
202 | 2273 | 2272 | Listen buddy - I'm a BellBot not a boy scout. Get your own map and compass if you're that keen.
203 | 2319 | 2318 | Hey, you're first class aren't you? So what's with the negative attitude.
204 | 2321 | 2320 | Whinge whinge whinge - you guys in first class are all the same.
205 | 2323 | 2322 | Guess what my motto is. Never feel sorry for the guys in first class.
206 | 2311 | 2310 | Yeah well, look on the bright side. There's plenty of things you do like.
207 | 2313 | 2312 | Know something? If you were First Class, things like that wouldn't bother you.
208 | 2315 | 2314 | Yeah, it's too bad.
209 | 2317 | 2316 | I'm real sorry to hear that.
210 | 2303 | 2302 | What do I care? You're here on a freebie - you put up with it.
211 | 2305 | 2304 | You're SGT Class buddy - it's all part of the package.
212 | 2307 | 2306 | I'll let you in on a secret. I'm programmed to ignore complaints from 3rd Class passengers.
213 | 2309 | 2308 | Know something? If I were you I'd feel the same way.
214 | 3095 | 3094 | No, they get in the way of a bot's night life.
215 | 3097 | 3096 | I do have a pet hate - mahogany.
216 | 3099 | 3098 | Takes itself too seriously.
217 | 3085 | 3084 | No I don't believe I have.
218 | 3069 | 3068 | No, but then what do I know ?
219 | 1909 | 1908 | Your BellBot at your service.
220 | 1949 | 1948 | Well howdy doody.
221 | 1951 | 1950 | The pleasure's all yours. Ha.
222 | 1953 | 1952 | Well it would be - I'm kinda special.
223 | 1955 | 1954 | If it's OK with you I'll wait till I know you better before answering that.
224 | 1957 | 1956 | See how you feel at the end of the trip.
225 | 1911 | 1910 | Hi, Krage here. Best looking BellBot in the business.
226 | 1913 | 1912 | Hi. The name's Krage. Spelt K-O-O-L.
227 | 1915 | 1914 | Hey little guy, want to see something funny?
228 | 1917 | 1916 | Look. No batteries. Cool huh?
229 | 1931 | 1930 | Hi how's it hanging?
230 | 1933 | 1932 | Cool.
231 | 1935 | 1934 | Each to his own.
232 | 1937 | 1936 | Hey, aren't you the moody one?
233 | 1939 | 1938 | Yo! Surf's Up!
234 | 1941 | 1940 | You are soooooo literal.
235 | 1943 | 1942 | Greetings biped!
236 | 1945 | 1944 | Nice to meet you.
237 | 1947 | 1946 | Good to meet you too.
238 | 1625 | 1624 | Fentible's a real comedian. He says there's a body up in the First Class Restaurant.
239 | 1643 | 1642 | Hey I've seen starlings up on the Promenade Deck. Maybe we could squish them in the big fan they got up there?
240 | 1645 | 1644 | Any crap on this ship, you'll find it in the Super Galactic Traveler food system. Maybe that's where you'll find the starling pur$e?
241 | 1647 | 1646 | You want an upgrade, you suck up to Marsinta. Make sure she's on a good setting though or she'll have your borms for earplugs.
242 | 1649 | 1648 | You don't like me the way I am, you go down the Sculpture Chamber and change my settings. See if I care.
243 | 1651 | 1650 | You know anything about music?
244 | 1655 | 1654 | Well head for the Music Room and do some learning.
245 | 1653 | 1652 | Well head for the Music Room. You'll die for Boppy Headcase and the Laid-back Loafers.
246 | 1657 | 1656 | If you don't like the Super Galactic Traveler room, and I don't blame you, you want to get the in-flight magazine - it always has plenty of ideas on getting upgraded.
247 | 1659 | 1658 | You want to help? You work out why the cyberintelligence has gone crazy.
248 | 1661 | 1660 | Look, why don't you head up to Titania's Chamber? That's where all the controls are.
249 | 1663 | 1662 | You ought to check out the TV Channels. Last time I looked there was something very weird going on in one of the first class staterooms.
250 | 1665 | 1664 | What do you do when you find a body? Search it for clues, that's what you do.
251 | 1627 | 1626 | Fentible was telling me there's a body down in the Bilge Room.
252 | 1667 | 1666 | I don't want to rush you or anything but if I were you I'd defuse the bomb before it goes off.
253 | 1669 | 1668 | You got to be pretty clever to defuse a bomb like that.
254 | 1671 | 1670 | Can you defuse the bomb?
255 | 1673 | 1672 | Oh yeah, like we did weaponry at BellBot school. Are you crazy?
256 | 1629 | 1628 | You ought to check out the Arboretum - I hear you can change the weather up there.
257 | 1631 | 1630 | You know where you get lemons? Lemon trees. And you know where you get lemon trees? The Arboretum.
258 | 1633 | 1632 | I think they've got lemons up in the Arboretum.
259 | 1635 | 1634 | If you're stuck for something to do you could always head up to the bar and see if you can help Fortillian with his Titanic Titillator.
260 | 1637 | 1636 | I bet this would be crushed to a pulp if I threw it from the Top of the Well.
261 | 1639 | 1638 | I've got a strange urge to throw a TV down the Well. I bet it'd make a radical sound!
262 | 1641 | 1640 | Yeah!!!!!!. You bet!!!!!! Smash the ship, smash the ship, smash the ship!!! BellBots are BAD!!!!!!!!!
263 | 3137 | 3136 | No. Work and play.
264 | 2083 | 2082 | To the left.
265 | 1971 | 1970 | How are you?
266 | 1973 | 1972 | I'm terrific.
267 | 1975 | 1974 | I'm as happy as a worb.
268 | 1977 | 1976 | I'm pretty cool - how are you?
269 | 1979 | 1978 | Yeah well, just keep your feelings to yourself and we'll get along fine.
270 | 1987 | 1986 | I'm OK - what's it to you?
271 | 1989 | 1988 | Boy am I hung-over. Some guy left a grease-gun out last night and I just had to finish it.
272 | 1959 | 1958 | Fine, how are your things?
273 | 1961 | 1960 | Nice words butter no turnips. Only thing I trust is a good tip.
274 | 1963 | 1962 | Know what I like? TIPS! Do you give good tips?
275 | 1825 | 1824 | Good. That means I don't have to bother.
276 | 1829 | 1828 | If you really loved me - YOU'D STOP ASKING ALL THESE QUESTIONS!!
277 | 2151 | 2150 | kiss my
278 | 3125 | 3124 | Nope.
279 | 2081 | 2080 | A word in your ear - don't hang around in Elevators. That guy is seriously weird.
280 | 2085 | 2084 | Been talking to the LiftBot? I guess somebody has to.
281 | 2087 | 2086 | Something you should know: Nobby's got a big imagination and a lousy memory.
282 | 2089 | 2088 | Nobby's been giving you some of that big hero stuff eh? Yep, he's had wounds in places most butchers don't know exist.
283 | 3117 | 3116 | What's a lightbulb?
284 | 3119 | 3118 | Good. I hope that slight delay ruined the gag.
285 | 3147 | 3146 | Never seen any.
286 | 3093 | 3092 | Nope but what do I know.
287 | 1795 | 1794 | Maybe.
288 | 1821 | 1820 | Who cares?
289 | 1827 | 1826 | Know what I think? I think we should love each other more.
290 | 1797 | 1796 | Maybe, maybe not.
291 | 1799 | 1798 | I wouldn't say no - but then again I wouldn't say yes.
292 | 1801 | 1800 | Possibly. And also possibly not.
293 | 1803 | 1802 | Could be.
294 | 1805 | 1804 | Perhaps. Then again, perhaps not.
295 | 1815 | 1814 | Yes and no, no and yes, kind of iffy in-betweeny.
296 | 1817 | 1816 | Why does it always have to be yes or no, for or against, positive or negative, up on something, down on something - why can't we be all middly and wishy washy and sort of squidgy and just relax and flop about. Put it another way - I don't know.
297 | 1819 | 1818 | To be honest, I don't really care.
298 | 1889 | 1888 | Don't you know?
299 | 1891 | 1890 | Sorry, can't tell you.
300 | 1895 | 1894 | Hey you're lucky - I wish I could forget it.
301 | 1897 | 1896 | Sorry, can't tell you.
302 | 1893 | 1892 | Well you don't need me to tell you do you?
303 | 3121 | 3120 | I'm too hot for any membership list.
304 | 2285 | 2284 | I dunno. Some kind of propulsion type thing. What am I - a rocket scientist all of a sudden?
305 | 2281 | 2280 | Only the hottest property around. I went on vacation once with her brother's dentist's neighbor.
306 | 1841 | 1840 | Never.
307 | 1843 | 1842 | All the time.
308 | 1845 | 1844 | Sometimes.
309 | 1847 | 1846 | Often.
310 | 1849 | 1848 | Occasionally.
311 | 1851 | 1850 | Hardly ever.
312 | 1853 | 1852 | When the mood's right.
313 | 1859 | 1858 | That'll be the day.
314 | 1861 | 1860 | From time to time.
315 | 2259 | 2258 | Nib? The biggest, most astounding, dangerous, skilful, horrific game in the galaxy. Ask the BarBot - he's the fan around here.
316 | 1747 | 1746 | No.
317 | 1765 | 1764 | No way.
318 | 1767 | 1766 | You gotta be kidding.
319 | 1769 | 1768 | Never.
320 | 1771 | 1770 | No chance.
321 | 1773 | 1772 | Not a hope.
322 | 1775 | 1774 | Nope.
323 | 1777 | 1776 | Out of the question.
324 | 1779 | 1778 | You are way off beam.
325 | 1781 | 1780 | Wrong.
326 | 1783 | 1782 | Bong! And the punter with the greasy skin asks another dumbass question and is kicked off the team!
327 | 1749 | 1748 | No no no no no no no!!!!
328 | 1785 | 1784 | Ding! And the little guy with the foot odor problem lets down the team with a staggeringly stupid question!
329 | 1787 | 1786 | That is a dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb question. No.
330 | 1789 | 1788 | Dumb dumb dumb dumb.
331 | 1791 | 1790 | Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. No.
332 | 1793 | 1792 | The answer's no. Funny, you were quite a bright being before you got upgraded.
333 | 1751 | 1750 | No.
334 | 1753 | 1752 | No.
335 | 1755 | 1754 | No.
336 | 1757 | 1756 | No.
337 | 1759 | 1758 | No.
338 | 1761 | 1760 | No.
339 | 1763 | 1762 | Nah.
340 | 2257 | 2256 | Whatever it is I don't want to know. When I go, I want it to be a surprise.
341 | 1863 | 1862 | I'm sure you're right.
342 | 1865 | 1864 | Damn, I'm good.
343 | 1867 | 1866 | That might be a good thing to do and then again it might not.
344 | 1869 | 1868 | Absolutely.
345 | 1871 | 1870 | Without a doubt.
346 | 1873 | 1872 | Do worbs lick their trails?
347 | 1875 | 1874 | Kinda pet. Leaves slime everywhere.
348 | 1877 | 1876 | Little furry pet. Leaves slime everywhere. Lives forever.
349 | 1879 | 1878 | Does the Gat wear a hat?
350 | 1883 | 1882 | Do you know nothing? Blerontis is where the Starship Titanic was built.
351 | 1881 | 1880 | Nothing important. Just the guy who runs the whole of Blerontis.
352 | 1885 | 1884 | Well you've got me there. Afraid I just don't know.
353 | 1887 | 1886 | Look, I'm just a Bot. I get things, I take things. I don't know the meaning of life or anything. Well obviously I know the meaning of life - who doesn't? What I'm trying to say is sometimes I just can't help you.
354 | 3101 | 3100 | Only the parrot.
355 | 2409 | 2408 | My personal suite. Ha. Just kidding, it's a.

378 | 2427 | 2426 | Take a look in the Arboretum.
379 | 2429 | 2428 | Take a look in the Embarkation Lobby.
380 | 2421 | 2420 | That is the Arboretum.
381 | 2425 | 2424 | That is the Embarkation Lobby.
382 | 2363 | 2362 | That is a

389 | 2413 | 2412 | That leads to Titania's Room.
390 | 2415 | 2414 | Try Titania's Room.
391 | 2379 | 2378 | Well.
392 | 1923 | 1922 | At the risk of repeating myself...
393 | 1925 | 1924 | I'll say it once and I'll say it again...
394 | 1927 | 1926 | If I've said it once I've said it a hundred times...
395 | 1929 | 1928 | Didn't you just say that, didn't you just say that, didn't you just say that, didn't you just say that? See what it's like having to hear the same thing over and over and over and over and over...
396 | 1807 | 1806 | Good question. Best one so far. Shame I don't know the answer.
397 | 1809 | 1808 | Good question. Not as good as the last one, but still very good.
398 | 1811 | 1810 | Now that's what I call a real question. I can't answer it but it's a real question all right.
399 | 1813 | 1812 | Good question. Very good question. Brilliant question. Astounding question. What was it again?
400 | 1831 | 1830 | If you really cared for me you wouldn't need to ask me that.
401 | 1833 | 1832 | How can you ask me that knowing what happened to me on Filigon Four?
402 | 2819 | 2818 | Al q'Hamra.
403 | 2821 | 2820 | Vortigan.
404 | 2823 | 2822 | Genneth.
405 | 2825 | 2824 | Bristil.
406 | 2827 | 2826 | Splod.
407 | 2829 | 2828 | Tarbert.
408 | 2831 | 2830 | Voedio.
409 | 2833 | 2832 | Hwhifft.
410 | 2817 | 2816 | The quonth is:
411 | 2835 | 2834 | Forty days hath Al q'Hamra, Tarbert, Hwhifft, Splod and Vortigan. All the rest have forty, too, i. e., Genneth, m'Bristil and Voedio.
412 | 2837 | 2836 | Forty-two? I never said that.
413 | 3165 | 3164 | The only science I care about is the science of keeping the party hot, the beer cold and the chicks warm.
414 | 3167 | 3166 | Who'd be a scientist? Me I'm a consumer and proud of it.
415 | 1919 | 1918 | You're repeating yourself.
416 | 1921 | 1920 | You ought to be careful. Repetition is the first sign of madness the first sign of madness the first sign of madness the first sign of madness. Ha.
417 | 3077 | 3076 | Probably. Can't quite remember the details though.
418 | 3089 | 3088 | Even if I had would I share my opinion with you.
419 | 3091 | 3090 | I don't get time off on this job.
420 | 3075 | 3074 | It's quite likely.
421 | 2325 | 2324 | If you ask me, you're the smartass round here.
422 | 2327 | 2326 | Nothing. Just passing the time of day.
423 | 2251 | 2250 | Smorbit's about so big.
424 | 3123 | 3122 | Me and clubs don't mix.
425 | 2267 | 2266 | It's a language interface dumbnuts.
426 | 2279 | 2278 | Starlight's a big travel company back on Blerontin.
427 | 2129 | 2128 | but I'm not too sure.
428 | 2147 | 2146 | but I'm having a spot of trouble working out
429 | 2149 | 2148 | but
430 | 2131 | 2130 | but I'm not quite certain.
431 | 2133 | 2132 | but I can't quite recall.
432 | 2135 | 2134 | but I'm having a teeny weeeny bit of trouble remembering.
433 | 2137 | 2136 | but it's kinda slipped the old memory.
434 | 2139 | 2138 | but I'm not absolutely certain.
435 | 2141 | 2140 | but I can't say with absolute conviction.
436 | 2143 | 2142 | but I find it difficult to be sure.
437 | 2145 | 2144 | but I couldn't say with rock-solid slithium-coated certainty.
438 | 2111 | 2110 | and I know you'll never understand
439 | 2113 | 2112 | and I know you'd never take it personally
440 | 2115 | 2114 | and don't you go blaming the old Titanic for it
441 | 2117 | 2116 | and I'll take it on the nose myself for it
442 | 2119 | 2118 | and don't even think about sticking it on someone
443 | 2121 | 2120 | and don't you take it personal
444 | 2123 | 2122 | and you'd better not shout it round the ship OK?
445 | 2125 | 2124 | and don't think it's got anything to do with you personally
446 | 2127 | 2126 | and I'd say this to any guy on board
447 | 2153 | 2152 | how.
448 | 2171 | 2170 | why you think that.
449 | 2173 | 2172 | why you're going to do that.
450 | 2175 | 2174 | why you keep asking these dumbass questions.
451 | 2177 | 2176 | why you think that's relevant.
452 | 2179 | 2178 | why you persist in being a jerk.
453 | 2181 | 2180 | why you insist on acting stupid.
454 | 2183 | 2182 | why you act so weird.

459 | 2191 | 2190 | who moved it.
460 | 2193 | 2192 | who took it.
461 | 2195 | 2194 | who hid it.

465 | 2203 | 2202 | where it went.
466 | 2205 | 2204 | where they went.
467 | 2207 | 2206 | where it could be
468 | 2209 | 2208 | where they could be
469 | 2157 | 2156 | how you might solve that.
470 | 2211 | 2210 | where he went.
471 | 2213 | 2212 | where they went.
472 | 2215 | 2214 | where he is.
473 | 2217 | 2216 | where they are.
474 | 2219 | 2218 | when.
475 | 2221 | 2220 | when we're going to arrive.
476 | 2223 | 2222 | when that happened.
477 | 2225 | 2224 | when - if at all.
478 | 2227 | 2226 | when that'll happen.
479 | 2229 | 2228 | what.
480 | 2159 | 2158 | how you might get that
481 | 2231 | 2230 | what that is.
482 | 2233 | 2232 | what you ought to do with it.
483 | 2235 | 2234 | what it does.
484 | 2237 | 2236 | what they do.
485 | 2239 | 2238 | what he does.

487 | 2243 | 2242 | what I mean any more.
488 | 2161 | 2160 | how you might get them
489 | 2163 | 2162 | how you might go there.
490 | 2165 | 2164 | why.
491 | 2167 | 2166 | why that happens.
492 | 2169 | 2168 | why you want to do that.
493 | 2091 | 2090 | The thing is
494 | 2109 | 2108 | It makes me feel bad to have to say this
495 | 2093 | 2092 | The trouble is

497 | 2097 | 2096 | It's sorta embarrassing

665 | 2853 | 2852 | Flatterday.
666 | 2855 | 2854 | Umph.
667 | 2839 | 2838 | Today is:
668 | 2463 | 2462 | Why don't you see what's going down in the Arboretum?
669 | 2465 | 2464 | Maybe you should head up to the Bar?
670 | 2471 | 2470 | Well, you've not been down to the Bottom of the Well yet have you? So now's a good time to do it.
671 | 2467 | 2466 | Maybe you should go see the Bilge Room?
672 | 2469 | 2468 | Why don't you check out the Bilge Room again?
673 | 2473 | 2472 | I don't recollect seeing you in the Creators Chamber - there's some weird stuff in there all right.
674 | 2475 | 2474 | You ought to take an Elevator - get a real fix on the ship.
675 | 2477 | 2476 | Why not get over to the Embarkation Lobby and go head to head with Marsinta?
676 | 2457 | 2456 | Well, it just might be worth taking a trip up to the First Class Restaurant.
677 | 2459 | 2458 | Maybe you should check out some of the First Class Staterooms.
678 | 2479 | 2478 | Take a boat down the Grand Canal - who knows what might turn up?
679 | 2481 | 2480 | Check out the Music Room and let Boppy Headcase open your ears.
680 | 2485 | 2484 | Take a leg-loosener round the Promenade Deck - who knows what might happen?
681 | 2483 | 2482 | You know the room with the Parrot? Well there's some odd stuff going on in there you know.
682 | 2487 | 2486 | I think a visit to the Sculpture Chamber is long overdue - but then, what do I know?
683 | 2461 | 2460 | Maybe you ought to have a good sniff round your Second Class Stateroom.
684 | 2489 | 2488 | You ought to get to grips with your SGT Bedroom - don't let the thing beat you man.
685 | 2491 | 2490 | If you haven't checked out the SGT Lounge well now's the time.
686 | 2493 | 2492 | The SGT Restaurant may not have the best food in town but things definitely aren't what they seem in there.
687 | 2501 | 2500 | Head up to the Top of the Well - get a fix on things.
688 | 2495 | 2494 | Far as I know you haven't checked out Titania's Room. Know what? You're really missing something there.
689 | 2499 | 2498 | Hey, try Titania's Room.
690 | 2497 | 2496 | I think you ought to give Titania's Room another look-over.
691 | 2247 | 2246 | It's a fluffy pet popular amongst old people and plumbers.
692 | 2249 | 2248 | It's good for cleaning pipes. Struggles a lot - I guess that's why it's so effective.
693 | 2287 | 2286 | The hottest, the latest, the fastest, the coolest, the bestest - you're talking major league BellBot here.
694 | 2431 | 2430 | Yeah well you shouldn't believe everything you hear in bars should you. Maybe it's time to change the BarBot's settings. Why don't you head over to the Sculpture Chamber and do just that?
695 | 2433 | 2432 | Fortillian told you that I had it - did he?
696 | 2435 | 2434 | Well sorry, I do not have the vision center. BarBot's playing games again. If I were you I'd go to the Sculpture Chamber and check out his honesty setting. Sounds to me like it's slipped a little.
697 | 2437 | 2436 | Look buddy, this is getting neither of us nowhere fast. GO to the Sculpture Chamber! Get hold of Fortillian's honesty lever! Crank it hard as you can then head back to the bar and get some sense out of him while you can. Capisce!!!???????
698 | 2009 | 2008 | Well? Got a job for me?
699 | 2011 | 2010 | You guest, me servant. You order, me obey - Capisce?
700 | 2013 | 2012 | OK you wanna play it the hard way? I'll come back when you want to talk to me...
701 | 2015 | 2014 | Hey! Remember me?
702 | 2017 | 2016 | Hey! Did you ever lay an egg?
703 | 2021 | 2020 | Well, don't knock it till you've tried it.
704 | 2019 | 2018 | Feels good don't it.
705 | 2023 | 2022 | Silence. Don't you just love it?
706 | 2025 | 2024 | Nothing worse than a noisy room eh?
707 | 2027 | 2026 | Boy it's hard to stop you talking.
708 | 2029 | 2028 | Kinda spooky with no other passengers isn't it?
709 | 2031 | 2030 | Where? Where? Where? Where? Where? Where?
710 | 2033 | 2032 | Must be a galactic record - ship this size going AWOL before she's even picked up the passengers.
711 | 3135 | 3134 | I'm too popular - just never in.
712 | 1991 | 1990 | Nice weather we're having.
713 | 1993 | 1992 | Are you crazy? The only good weather is no weather.
714 | 1995 | 1994 | What kind of dumb-ass statement is that? No-one likes weather.
715 | 1997 | 1996 | Weather's illogical.
716 | 1999 | 1998 | You like weather? Weird.
717 | 2001 | 2000 | If you like weather - we've got all sorts here.
718 | 2003 | 2002 | Are you crazy? We're on a Starship. Starships don't have weather.
719 | 2005 | 2004 | Hey guys we got lucky! It's the Conversationalist of the Year!
720 | 2007 | 2006 | Hey if you're a weather fan you ought to head up to the Arboretum - you can get off on all kinds of weather for free.
721 | 2253 | 2252 | Bilge? Crapooli. Rubbola. Lies and deceptions.
722 | 2587 | 2586 | It's a trans-Galactic liner.
723 | 2573 | 2572 | It sucks, it blows and anything else, it doesn't knows.
724 | 3183 | 3182 | Whatever.
725 | 3179 | 3178 | Just what it says it is, plug it in and you can send yourself.
726 | 2585 | 2584 | It's called the Starship Titanic.
727 | 3153 | 3152 | Who knows?
728 | 2583 | 2582 | We're on the Starship Titanic.
729 | 2329 | 2328 | HEY FENTIBLE!!!! GET YOUR ASS HERE RIGHT NOW!!!!!!
730 | 2331 | 2330 | HEY FENTIBLE!!!! GET YOUR ASS DOWN HERE RIGHT NOW!!!!!!
731 | 2333 | 2332 | HEY FENTIBLE!!!! GET YOUR ASS UP HERE RIGHT NOW!!!!!!
732 | 2335 | 2334 | HEY FENTIBLE!!!! GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE RIGHT NOW!!!!!!
733 | 3181 | 3180 | Wherever you want.
734 | 3163 | 3162 | Blerontis.
735 | 3157 | 3156 | You never been to a bar? Kinda logical place to start looking.
736 | 3161 | 3160 | Wouldn't I like to know? Got wiped clean at the factory so I can't tell you.
737 | 1899 | 1898 | Krage Koyotaal at your service.
738 | 2337 | 2336 | Brobostigon? Fat guy in charge of building the ship.
739 | 1823 | 1822 | I do... I care...
740 | 2339 | 2338 | Leovinus is way out of your league. He's the guy who created this floating coffin. I mean wondrous Starship.
741 | 2341 | 2340 | Scraliontis? He's the Accountant.
742 | 3109 | 3108 | What do I care.
743 | 1675 | 1674 | Oh yeah, right on!
744 | 1693 | 1692 | Yes. Or do I mean no? Ha only kidding. It's yes. Yes yes yes yes yes.
745 | 1695 | 1694 | No. All right. Yes.
746 | 1697 | 1696 | You are so right.
747 | 1699 | 1698 | Yea. Cool.
748 | 1701 | 1700 | For a guy from a dirt planet you're pretty bright.
749 | 1703 | 1702 | What's a dirt planet?
750 | 1705 | 1704 | You never asked yourself why they called it - Earth?
751 | 1707 | 1706 | Fine by me.
752 | 1709 | 1708 | Help yourself.
753 | 1711 | 1710 | Right.
754 | 1677 | 1676 | Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes!!!!
755 | 1713 | 1712 | Yes indeedy.
756 | 1715 | 1714 | Sure looks that way.
757 | 1717 | 1716 | You better believe it.
758 | 1719 | 1718 | Of course.
759 | 1721 | 1720 | Go ahead.
760 | 1723 | 1722 | Do what you want.
761 | 1725 | 1724 | Definitely.
762 | 1727 | 1726 | Not a doubt.
763 | 1729 | 1728 | It's a sure thing.
764 | 1731 | 1730 | Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Yes.
765 | 1679 | 1678 | Yes.
766 | 1733 | 1732 | Yes. Or as the people of Chan would say: No.
767 | 1735 | 1734 | No-one's ever been to Chan - ass-holes always give you the wrong directions.
768 | 1737 | 1736 | Bong! And the little guy with the funny hair in third class gets another question right!
769 | 1739 | 1738 | Bong! And the little guy with the funny hair in second class gets another question right!
770 | 1741 | 1740 | Bong! And the little guy with the funny hair in first class gets another question right!
771 | 1743 | 1742 | Yes folks it's major breakthrough time here on the Starship Titanic as the all-time loser in the vest with the egg-stains GETS A QUESTION RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!
772 | 1745 | 1744 | Bong! Another astonishingly correct answer!
773 | 1681 | 1680 | Yes.
774 | 1683 | 1682 | Yes.
775 | 1685 | 1684 | Yes.
776 | 1687 | 1686 | Yes.
777 | 1689 | 1688 | Yes.
778 | 1691 | 1690 | Yeah.
779 | 3081 | 3080 | You know me - I like everything.
780 | 3827 | 3826 | You may not be able to fix D'Astragaar - but you could sure as hell find out what happened to him.
781 | 3821 | 3820 | This is your wondrous stateroom. Cool lighting don't you think?
782 | 3823 | 3822 | This is your wondrous stateroom. Groovy lighting don't you think?
783 | 3547 | 3546 | Have you found your room?
784 | 3551 | 3550 | Just stand by a room and check its number in your PET if you're having trouble.
785 | 3549 | 3548 | How about those pistachios - nice huh? Lucky that damned parrot hasn't found them yet?
786 | 3817 | 3816 | To be real honest - this area's kinda dull. Why not check out your room?
787 | 3553 | 3552 | Hey, they got pistachios. You ought to eat those up before the parrot gets them.
788 | 3555 | 3554 | If you're getting fed up eating the pistachios, I guess you could always call in a parrot strike.
789 | 3819 | 3818 | Funny, I never really noticed how strange the bowls were before.
790 | 3901 | 3900 | Time you figured out how to fix Titania I guess.
791 | 3953 | 3952 | Got any more TV's, that was fun!
792 | 3925 | 3924 | Ouch!
793 | 3927 | 3926 | Don't do that!
794 | 3929 | 3928 | Hey man! That hurt!
795 | 3931 | 3930 | Don't prod me. OK?
796 | 3933 | 3932 | Prod me again and I'm outta here.
797 | 3511 | 3510 | All you got to do here is help Fortillian mix the cocktail. Easy.
798 | 3513 | 3512 | Mmm. I guess the best thing you can do is look round the ship for the ingredients for the Titanic Titillator.
799 | 3825 | 3824 | Why talk to me when you could be talking to a real expert - Fortillian.
800 | 3465 | 3464 | If I were you I'd check to make sure the big Succ-U-Bus is working.
801 | 3469 | 3468 | Quick. Search the body.
802 | 3467 | 3466 | Sounds to me like the Big Mother's got something stuck in its throat. You need to make it sneeze it out somehow.
803 | 3471 | 3470 | Check the fat guy's pockets.
804 | 3797 | 3796 | This is where the stuff that nobody wants turns up. Check it out real careful.
805 | 3253 | 3252 | The Big Mother's the mother of all Succ-U-Buses. Lives in the Bilge Room.
806 | 3255 | 3254 | The fat guy in the Succ-U-Bus is Brobostigon. Or should I say was.
807 | 3881 | 3880 | Hey, don't suppose you've managed to disarm that bomb yet have you?
808 | 3883 | 3882 | Bomb's about to go off. Just thought you might want to know.
809 | 3503 | 3502 | Mmm. If Nobby's head's down here - maybe you ought to check out the Elevators to see what's been stuck in its place?
810 | 3505 | 3504 | Now who was talking to me about TV's? Yea, I know - the BarBot.
811 | 3853 | 3852 | Brobostigon.
812 | 3787 | 3786 | Yes even an amateur such as yourself may alter my settings. Just head for the sculpture Chamber and start pulling the levers.
813 | 3303 | 3302 | Easy. All you got to do is get to the Bridge.
814 | 3607 | 3606 | That was the general idea. I sure hope you've got it in you.
815 | 3313 | 3312 | Yeah I know. That's the funny thing: I was only kidding about it being useful. Are you crazy - trying to navigate across the universe using a photo of the sky above your house. Ha.
816 | 3315 | 3314 | You can use it for looking at. That's about all it's good for.
817 | 3317 | 3316 | You'd have to ask the navigator.
818 | 3321 | 3320 | It can help keep your spirits up can't it?
819 | 3283 | 3282 | Put a chicken under the spout. Then put your glass under the chicken. The sauce will slide off the chicken into the glass.
820 | 3201 | 3200 | Fentible doesn't have access to all areas. Whereas me - I can go almost any place. Except the Bridge of course.
821 | 3289 | 3288 | Romantic notion. Probably predates lawyers.
822 | 3493 | 3492 | OK. If the lever's not working maybe the damn thing's blown a fuse.
823 | 3495 | 3494 | If you ask me you'll never figure out this place till you get the lever to work.
824 | 3497 | 3496 | This is where the top guys had all their meetings. You want to access those TV's I guess you'll need a password.
825 | 3233 | 3232 | Just pull the lever.
826 | 3235 | 3234 | Maybe it's blown a fuse.
827 | 3237 | 3236 | This is where the big cheeses used to have their pow wows - somewhere in here is their communications system.
828 | 3807 | 3806 | This room was used by the guys who ran things round here - my bet is it's full of secrets and codes.
829 | 3239 | 3238 | The lever over there operates the beams I guess.
830 | 3231 | 3230 | You're looking at the three big cheeses there: Leovinus, Scraliontis and Brobostigon.
831 | 3775 | 3774 | Yeah! There go my settings. Yessssssssssssss.
832 | 3777 | 3776 | Uh-oh. There go my settings.
833 | 3779 | 3778 | Yesssssssssssss! There go my settings again.
834 | 3781 | 3780 | Uh-oh. There go my settings again.
835 | 3273 | 3272 | Maybe you should find something to wipe the chicken?
836 | 3263 | 3262 | You know they got all kinds of controls and stuff in Titania's Chamber: Maybe they run the chickens from there.
837 | 3949 | 3948 | I'm dawdling as quickly as I can.
838 | 3951 | 3950 | I'm relaxing as quickly as I can.
839 | 3323 | 3322 | Cough, cough, cough...
840 | 3871 | 3870 | D'Astragaar.
841 | 3831 | 3830 | Hey - did you find that thing you were looking for?
842 | 3373 | 3372 | Down there.
843 | 3391 | 3390 | Down there.
844 | 3389 | 3388 | In the Elevator.
845 | 3407 | 3406 | In the Elevator.
846 | 3383 | 3382 | Then straight ahead.
847 | 3401 | 3400 | Then straight ahead.
848 | 3379 | 3378 | Then left.
849 | 3397 | 3396 | Then left.
850 | 3381 | 3380 | Then right.
851 | 3399 | 3398 | Then right.
852 | 3385 | 3384 | Through the doors.
853 | 3403 | 3402 | Through the doors.
854 | 3375 | 3374 | Turn left.
855 | 3393 | 3392 | Turn left.
856 | 3377 | 3376 | Turn right.
857 | 3395 | 3394 | Turn right.
858 | 3387 | 3386 | Up the steps.
859 | 3405 | 3404 | Up the steps.
860 | 3977 | 3976 | I hate the fall. All the trees are bare.
861 | 3973 | 3972 | I hate the spring. Makes my nose all runny and I sneeze all the time.
862 | 3975 | 3974 | I hate the summer. Too darn hot.
863 | 3971 | 3970 | I don't like winter. I hate it when the canal freezes over.
864 | 3913 | 3912 | Earlier.
865 | 3473 | 3472 | First of all - if I were you I'd check out this level then head on down to your room.
866 | 3475 | 3474 | Mmm - let me think. The Starship Titanic is drifting helplessly through hyperspace; the central intelligence of the ship has been cruelly torn apart by unknown hands; We Bots are unable to solve the problem ourselves. Perhaps you should be GETTING OFF YOUR ASS AND DOING SOMETHING BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE AND WE ALL DIE? Just an idea, of course.
867 | 3477 | 3476 | Do what new passengers always do - wander round looking dumb and wishing you'd bought 1st Class.
868 | 3479 | 3478 | Maybe you should find your room then check out the upgrade situation.
869 | 3801 | 3800 | It's kinda traditional, I know, but we like it that way.
870 | 3353 | 3352 | That's the DeskBot.
871 | 3351 | 3350 | That's the door to the Service Elevator.
872 | 3355 | 3354 | That's the door to The Top of the Well.
873 | 3799 | 3798 | This is where you check in. And of course make friends with Marsinta.
874 | 3617 | 3616 | Elevator 1
875 | 3619 | 3618 | Elevator 2
876 | 3621 | 3620 | Elevator 3
877 | 3623 | 3622 | Elevator 4
878 | 3625 | 3624 | -
879 | 3937 | 3936 | Maybe it's just blown a fuse?
880 | 3445 | 3444 | If you ask, I'll be happy to get it for you.
881 | 3519 | 3518 | You're going to have to get on the right side of D'Astragaar if you ask me.
882 | 3521 | 3520 | Mmm. Just between you and me - how about changing this damned music?
883 | 3523 | 3522 | Somehow you're going to have to force D'Astragaar to let you check out the tables.
884 | 3257 | 3256 | There must be a music player round here somewhere - I guess all you have to do is just change it.
885 | 3443 | 3442 | That light sure looks odd to me.
886 | 3515 | 3514 | Maybe you should check out the TV Channels.
887 | 3517 | 3516 | Maybe you should check out some of the other 1st Class rooms.
888 | 3867 | 3866 | Fentible.

931 | 3865 | 3864 | Fortillian.
932 | 3943 | 3942 | You can send small things through the Succ-U-Bus - so don't waste my time with menial tasks.
933 | 3187 | 3186 | Hey man, you're looking lost. Can I help?
934 | 3189 | 3188 | Yo! Krage to the rescue! Got any fetching? Got any carrying?
935 | 3191 | 3190 | Hi. Just passing through. Anything I can do for you?
936 | 3193 | 3192 | Want some help?
937 | 3195 | 3194 | Anything I can do?
938 | 3197 | 3196 | You look like you could do with some help.
939 | 3199 | 3198 | Yo. You look like you need Krage.
940 | 3185 | 3184 | Hey man, I know somewhere you've not been yet - the Bilge Room. I bet there's loads of stuff down there.
941 | 3961 | 3960 | Take a stroll round the Arboretum. If you don't think it's looking cool at this time of year, choose another one.
942 | 3957 | 3956 | Maybe you should try and introduce a little harmony into the Music Room.
943 | 3959 | 3958 | There's an awful row going on in the music room. Maybe you could make it better. You couldn't make it worse.
944 | 3447 | 3446 | I'm pretty good, how about you?
945 | 3451 | 3450 | Hey! Given there's nobody flying this thing you were lucky we hit it at all.
946 | 3449 | 3448 | Oh yeah? Well I guess what you don't know can't upset you.
947 | 3267 | 3266 | Maybe you should check out the little control box in Titania's Chamber?
948 | 3215 | 3214 | Well, you're just going to have to kick his ass.
949 | 3305 | 3304 | First you have to know where it is.
950 | 3277 | 3276 | You'll need to put a chicken under the spout or the sauce won't come out.
951 | 3609 | 3608 | Just a question of who you know.
952 | 3899 | 3898 | I was kinda hoping you'd know how to do that.
953 | 3251 | 3250 | Remember the Elevator you took to get into the ship? Just hop in and press one of the buttons.
954 | 3587 | 3586 | Just check out the Top of the Well.
955 | 3589 | 3588 | Take one of the Elevators and ask a LiftBot. They're real helpful.
956 | 3601 | 3600 | I prefer the word doomed. Kinda dramatic isn't it?
957 | 3963 | 3962 | There's only one Arboretum.
958 | 3965 | 3964 | There are four seasons, of course. How many did you expect?
959 | 3269 | 3268 | Maybe you could make the chicken less tasty. What about putting mustard on it?
960 | 3413 | 3412 | If you want to call the Elevator, use your PET - it's got a nice Elevator picture in control mode.
961 | 3325 | 3324 | Hummm Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm...
962 | 3459 | 3458 | I'm so excited for you.
963 | 3917 | 3916 | If you hurry you might just make it.
964 | 3905 | 3904 | Immediately.
965 | 3941 | 3940 | In the Bilge Room.
966 | 3829 | 3828 | Probably. Whole damn ship's turning into a puzzle if you ask me.
967 | 3915 | 3914 | Just missed it.
968 | 3879 | 3878 | Koyotaal. The Fourth.
969 | 3863 | 3862 | Krage.
970 | 3877 | 3876 | Krage.
971 | 3875 | 3874 | Krage Koyotaal IV.
972 | 3911 | 3910 | Later.
973 | 3851 | 3850 | Leovinus.
974 | 3499 | 3498 | I think one of the Elevators is broken. Have you figured out which one yet?
975 | 3501 | 3500 | Fentible was telling me he saw a LiftBot head down in the Bottom of the Well. You been down there yet?
976 | 3869 | 3868 | Marsinta.
977 | 3859 | 3858 | Me.
978 | 3507 | 3506 | Whoa! This place is way too complicated for me. Ask Fentible.
979 | 3509 | 3508 | Music Room's beyond me man. Fentible's the music expert round here.
980 | 3327 | 3326 | Mumble mumble...
981 | 3329 | 3328 | Mumble mumble...
982 | 3331 | 3330 | Mumble mumble...
983 | 3333 | 3332 | Mumble mumble...
984 | 3461 | 3460 | I guess as names go it could be worse.
985 | 3463 | 3462 | Mmm. If you're expecting sympathy you've come to the wrong Bot.
986 | 3221 | 3220 | Course if you could get an upgrade - you could have a lot of fun in there.
987 | 3247 | 3246 | Woa! You'll need an upgrade before they let you in there.
988 | 3249 | 3248 | No entry to passengers of your class.
989 | 3903 | 3902 | Never.
990 | 3979 | 3978 | Hi, I'm Krage, I'm your BellBot today. Hey, I see you're not carrying any luggage. That's great! I can take a little time off, right away. And I see you're SuperGalactic Traveler class, so I guess you can find your own way to your room. The door's over there, the Elevator's around someplace. Relax! Stay cool! Enjoy!
991 | 3455 | 3454 | Yeah. I know.
992 | 3453 | 3452 | Hey! You like weather you ought to check out the Arboretum.
993 | 3847 | 3846 | I don't think it's important.
994 | 3217 | 3216 | Sorry. That's off limits to 2nd Class. They only let the big spenders in there.
995 | 3219 | 3218 | Sorry. That's off limits to 3rd class.
996 | 3223 | 3222 | Sorry man. They don't let riff-raff in there. I mean Super Galactic Traveler Class.
997 | 3955 | 3954 | Ok-damn-dokey.
998 | 3525 | 3524 | Mmm. Starlings - fan. Fan - starlings. I think there could be quite a useful connection here. Kinda thing the BarBot would be interested in.
999 | 3527 | 3526 | Is the fan switch working properly? Maybe the fuse has gone.
1000 | 3259 | 3258 | I guess the fuse is in the fuse box in Titania's Chamber.
1001 | 3485 | 3484 | There's something funny about that cage. I think you need to get the parrot out of the way.
1002 | 3487 | 3486 | Maybe you could give the parrot something to eat - that way you could reach in and grab the perch.
1003 | 3363 | 3362 | Maybe the perch is important.
1004 | 3365 | 3364 | Maybe you should check your baggage?
1005 | 3367 | 3366 | I think there's something in the lampshade. You're gonna have to - I don't know - blow it out somehow.
1006 | 3369 | 3368 | What you need is a giant blower. You need something that blows like the Succ-U-Bus on a bad day.
1007 | 3371 | 3370 | If only you could connect up the Succ-U-Bus to the lamp.
1008 | 3357 | 3356 | That's the parrot.
1009 | 3361 | 3360 | That's a perch.
1010 | 3359 | 3358 | That's the Succ-U-Bus.
1011 | 3805 | 3804 | This room's weird. Parrots, sticks, funny perches - grab what you can.
1012 | 3747 | 3746 | If you stand outside a room then look in Designer Room Number mode of your PET you'll find out exactly where your are.
1013 | 3935 | 3934 | Sorry, was that some feeble attempt at communication?
1014 | 3907 | 3906 | Right away.
1015 | 3711 | 3710 | Room 1
1016 | 3729 | 3728 | Room 10
1017 | 3731 | 3730 | Room 11
1018 | 3733 | 3732 | Room 12
1019 | 3735 | 3734 | Room 13
1020 | 3737 | 3736 | Room 14
1021 | 3739 | 3738 | Room 15
1022 | 3741 | 3740 | Room 16
1023 | 3743 | 3742 | Room 17
1024 | 3745 | 3744 | Room 18
1025 | 3713 | 3712 | Room 2
1026 | 3715 | 3714 | Room 3
1027 | 3717 | 3716 | Room 4
1028 | 3719 | 3718 | Room 5
1029 | 3721 | 3720 | Room 6
1030 | 3723 | 3722 | Room 7
1031 | 3725 | 3724 | Room 8
1032 | 3727 | 3726 | Room 9
1033 | 3873 | 3872 | The RowBot.
1034 | 3281 | 3280 | Get another chicken and put the glass under it.
1035 | 3489 | 3488 | Have yourself a bit of fun - that's what I'd do. Go on, pull some of the levers and see what happens.
1036 | 3491 | 3490 | Figured it out yet? The statues connect up with the Bots. Pull the levers and the Bots' character settings change.
1037 | 3809 | 3808 | I'm kinda fond of this room - pull a few levers and you'll see why.
1038 | 3433 | 3432 | Maybe you sent the parrot to another 2nd Class Room.
1039 | 3435 | 3434 | Maybe you got the code wrong and sent the parrot somewhere else?
1040 | 3437 | 3436 | If you got the code wrong, the parrot will have been sent to the Bilge Room.
1041 | 3439 | 3438 | Maybe you're in the wrong room.
1042 | 3441 | 3440 | Maybe this isn't your room.
1043 | 3855 | 3854 | Scraliontis.
1044 | 3539 | 3538 | To be truly honest there's not a lot of action in here.
1045 | 3541 | 3540 | If I were you I'd move on. If you've had your fun fiddling with the picture that is.
1046 | 3813 | 3812 | I don't know what you're supposed to do down here. Look at the art I guess.
1047 | 3533 | 3532 | Have you got your upgrade?
1048 | 3537 | 3536 | Well if I were you I'd get your bedroom worked out and take it from there.
1049 | 3535 | 3534 | Have you checked out the restaurant?
1050 | 3811 | 3810 | Only thing to do here is find your crap room, get yourself a crap meal and wonder why you didn't book first class.
1051 | 3543 | 3542 | If the food machine's not working, maybe you should check out the fuse box.
1052 | 3545 | 3544 | If the chicken's coming out too fast maybe you can change the speed up in the fuse box.
1053 | 3815 | 3814 | Try the machine and discover why they call it fast food.
1054 | 3261 | 3260 | The fuse box is up in Titania's Chamber.
1055 | 3529 | 3528 | Mmm. Well if I were you I'd pull out all the furniture at the bottom, so's at least you can get the bed out and take a rest.
1056 | 3531 | 3530 | Maybe you need to relax - why not just get the bed out and watch TV?
1057 | 3833 | 3832 | Sigh...
1058 | 3835 | 3834 | Sigh...
1059 | 3837 | 3836 | Sigh...
1060 | 3839 | 3838 | Sigh...
1061 | 3841 | 3840 | Sigh...
1062 | 3843 | 3842 | Sigh...
1063 | 3845 | 3844 | Sigh...
1064 | 3345 | 3344 | Atchoo...
1065 | 3347 | 3346 | Atchoo...
1066 | 3349 | 3348 | Atchoo...
1067 | 3909 | 3908 | Soon.
1068 | 3613 | 3612 | Starlight Lines.
1069 | 3203 | 3202 | Oh. Sorry, gotta go. Talk to you later.
1070 | 3205 | 3204 | You've probably realised by now that I am a very popular Bot. Gotta go.
1071 | 3207 | 3206 | Busy busy busy. See you later.
1072 | 3209 | 3208 | Gotta go!
1073 | 3211 | 3210 | That's me outa here!
1074 | 3213 | 3212 | See ya later.
1075 | 3591 | 3590 | Hey man you don't have any.
1076 | 3299 | 3298 | Bots can't go to the Bridge. Bots can't even go to Titania's Chamber. We're not so good at walking upside down.
1077 | 3301 | 3300 | You gotta walk upside down to get into Titania's Chamber. Not easy if you're a Bot.
1078 | 3767 | 3766 | I'll meet you there. Just call me once you've arrived.
1079 | 3885 | 3884 | What do you mean? We're already there!
1080 | 3889 | 3888 | My pleasure.
1081 | 3891 | 3890 | You're welcome.
1082 | 3893 | 3892 | Have a nice day now.
1083 | 3857 | 3856 | The Gat.
1084 | 3335 | 3334 | Uhh humm...
1085 | 3337 | 3336 | Uhh humm...
1086 | 3339 | 3338 | Uhh humm...
1087 | 3341 | 3340 | Uhh humm...
1088 | 3343 | 3342 | Uhh humm...
1089 | 3241 | 3240 | OK give me the tip.
1090 | 3243 | 3242 | Are you crazy?! Tips are illegal on the Starship Titanic. Don't even say the word - you'll get us both fired.
1091 | 3245 | 3244 | TIP ALERT TIP ALERT TIP ALERT!
1092 | 3849 | 3848 | Titania.
1093 | 3297 | 3296 | Yeah. That's why Fentible got you on board. Her brain is in pieces - and you're the only hope we've got of finding them. Do that and you get control of the ship.
1094 | 3481 | 3480 | Head up the steps and check out Titania's Chamber - they don't let guys like me up there.
1095 | 3483 | 3482 | Have you checked out all the Elevators? And the Pellerator?
1096 | 3557 | 3556 | Bots aren't allowed in Titania's Chamber so I don't know how much I can help you.
1097 | 3559 | 3558 | Mmm. All I know about Titania's Chamber is that Titania kinda floats around in there running the ship and everything.
1098 | 3561 | 3560 | Did you check out Titania's head?
1099 | 3565 | 3564 | I guess you ought to have another look. Titania's gone wrong in a big way.
1100 | 3563 | 3562 | Was anything missing?
1101 | 3567 | 3566 | I got a feeling that arming a bomb will not reduce the problems we face on this ship.
1102 | 3569 | 3568 | You got to be careful when it comes to disarming bombs. You can be too clever you know.
1103 | 3571 | 3570 | Hey man I just say what I'm programmed to. Doesn't automatically follow that I know what I mean.
1104 | 3573 | 3572 | Have you tried putting some of Titania's bits back in her head yet?
1105 | 3577 | 3576 | Mmm. Maybe you should look round the ship to see if there's any more Titania bits before you try and put them in her head.
1106 | 3575 | 3574 | Well maybe when you've got them all it'll make more sense.
1107 | 3579 | 3578 | You know, somewhere in Titania's Chamber there's a big fuse box. I guess if you're kind of running out of ideas, that could be worth checking out.
1108 | 3417 | 3416 | That's the First Class Canal.
1109 | 3415 | 3414 | That's the Second Class Canal.
1110 | 3419 | 3418 | That's for First Class passengers only.
1111 | 3421 | 3420 | That's for Second Class passengers only.
1112 | 3411 | 3410 | It's an Elevator. But kinda sideways if you know what I mean.
1113 | 3423 | 3422 | You're Super Galactic Traveler Class. I'm afraid.
1114 | 3425 | 3424 | Oh yeah. Elevators 2 and 4 don't go down to SGT Class.
1115 | 3409 | 3408 | That's the Pellerator.
1116 | 3803 | 3802 | You got a big choice up here - check out all the public rooms or take an Elevator to the bedrooms.
1117 | 3785 | 3784 | They're a cool way of tuning my already perfect personality.
1118 | 3967 | 3966 | Winter, spring, summer, fall. They're all cool.
1119 | 3969 | 3968 | Winter, spring, summer, fall. Too cold, too polleny, too hot, or too drab. Take your pick.
1120 | 3789 | 3788 | My reliability is high and my speed is high.
1121 | 3791 | 3790 | My reliability is low and my speed is high.
1122 | 3793 | 3792 | My reliability is high and my speed is low.
1123 | 3795 | 3794 | My reliability is low and my speed is low.
1124 | 3945 | 3944 | My reliability is low and my speed is medium.
1125 | 3947 | 3946 | My reliability is high and my speed is medium.
1126 | 3611 | 3610 | You got a problem with your house sue Starlight.
1127 | 3581 | 3580 | Leovinus and some of the management had a little falling out.
1128 | 3279 | 3278 | If you haven't got a glass, maybe Fortillian's got one.
1129 | 3783 | 3782 | My cellpoint settings if you really want to get personal.
1130 | 3605 | 3604 | Somebody's pulled out all the intelligent bits from inside her head and hidden them round the ship. Not what I'd call neighborly.
1131 | 3457 | 3456 | I'm the BellBot. You tell me you want things - I go get 'em.
1132 | 3769 | 3768 | My ass, I guess.
1133 | 3919 | 3918 | Whenever you like.
1134 | 3431 | 3430 | Dammit. I know I've seen one somewhere.
1135 | 3429 | 3428 | Hammers are available in hammer dispensers.
1136 | 3583 | 3582 | Blerontis.
1137 | 3599 | 3598 | Blerontis is - well, behind us, I guess.
1138 | 3293 | 3292 | It's very hard to find. Only Titania can give you access to the Bridge and she's lost her mind.
1139 | 3295 | 3294 | Look man I really don't know. Maybe if you get Titania working you'll find out from her.
1140 | 3265 | 3264 | If you want more switches you'll have to go up to Titania's Chamber and check out the control box.
1141 | 3275 | 3274 | I know they have lots of napkins in the 1st Class Restaurant.
1142 | 3939 | 3938 | They've got fuse boxes in Titania's Chamber.
1143 | 3923 | 3922 | Ever heard the word - Bar?
1144 | 3921 | 3920 | Hey radical idea - you tried the Restaurant?
1145 | 3271 | 3270 | You get three sauces here: tomato, mustard and bird. If you put mustard on the chicken maybe the Succ-U-Bus won't eat it.
1146 | 3597 | 3596 | Officially, we're going to Vastan... Unofficially we're drifting helplessly in space.
1147 | 3291 | 3290 | Where indeed? You can tell he's not on the Bridge from the way the ship's just wandering about. Probably holed up with his lawyer somewhere.
1148 | 3615 | 3614 | There aren't any passengers because we got lost before we could pick them up.
1149 | 3307 | 3306 | I don't know. I don't think the ship knows. And if you don't know, who does?
1150 | 3309 | 3308 | Wanna know something funny?
1151 | 3311 | 3310 | If you had a picture of the night sky above your house, you'd probably be able to use it to navigate your way home.
1152 | 3585 | 3584 | Easy. Just check out the designer room code in your PET.
1153 | 3319 | 3318 | Baled out with the captain I should think.
1154 | 3887 | 3886 | You're in it man.
1155 | 3225 | 3224 | Maybe you've got to use one of the mini-Elevators to get to your room. The Designer Room Number mode in your PET tells you your room number, and it also tells you the number of the room you're standing in front of.
1156 | 3227 | 3226 | Hey dumb-butt - you're on the wrong floor. Check the address in your PET.
1157 | 3229 | 3228 | You took the wrong Elevator, dumbass. Check the address in your PET.
1158 | 3593 | 3592 | Are you crazy? Nobody uses those any more.
1159 | 3595 | 3594 | If you have to ask you'll never understand.
1160 | 3895 | 3894 | You know how it is. Been here, been there. Relaxed a little.
1161 | 3751 | 3750 | In the Bar.
1162 | 3765 | 3764 | Your looking at him dumbass.
1163 | 3749 | 3748 | In the Embarkation Lobby.
1164 | 3763 | 3762 | Fentible? Who knows? If you want him, you could always try calling him with your PET.
1165 | 3759 | 3758 | In the Elevator.
1166 | 3757 | 3756 | In the 1st Class Restaurant.
1167 | 3753 | 3752 | In the Parrot Lobby.
1168 | 3755 | 3754 | All over the damn place.
1169 | 3761 | 3760 | On the 1st Class Canal.
1170 | 3771 | 3770 | Some dodgy outfit called Starstruct.
1171 | 3285 | 3284 | Who do you think? Nobody - that's who. The captain bailed out about three seconds after the launch.
1172 | 3773 | 3772 | Starlight Lines - nice name, shame about the product.
1173 | 3287 | 3286 | They always do. First sign of trouble and off they go. Everybody has golden parachutes these days. Even the tiniest alarm always causes a very pretty display. Formation panic.
1174 | 3861 | 3860 | You.
1175 | 3603 | 3602 | And a very pleasant little planet it was.
1176 | 3427 | 3426 | I think you'll need a hammer to get that stick.
1177 | 3897 | 3896 | Gotta learn to get over it man. Move on.
1178 | 1 | 0 | Ha ha...
1179 | 3 | 2 | Boom boom...
1180 | 7 | 6 | He he he...
1181 | 9 | 8 | He he he...
1182 | 11 | 10 | Ha ha ha...
1183 | 5 | 4 | Dur dur tschhhh...
1184 | 1355 | 1354 | Truly you are an immensely brilliant and clever person for knowing how to do that. Human, I salute you. Shame about the haircut but you can't be perfect.
1185 | 1351 | 1350 | Know what I think? I think a fuse has gone somewhere. Question is - where?
1186 | 1357 | 1356 | Yeah, maybe you're right - the hair's ok. I know. It's the face that's wrong.
1187 | 1353 | 1352 | Well, you've got to start somewhere.
1188 | 1347 | 1346 | That's no good there's too much foliage in the way. You need to change the weather.
1189 | 1341 | 1340 | You know, I thought a long stick would come in handy. Maybe you should call me psychic.
1190 | 1349 | 1348 | There's bound to be a switch round here somewhere.
1191 | 1345 | 1344 | That's no good, it's frozen. You need to change the weather.
1192 | 13 | 12 | Whoa! You can't go prying into my financial affairs.
1193 | 1159 | 1158 | Never touch the stuff thanks. Course, if you want to add the price of a double Brain-Pickler to my tip, I can't stop you.
1194 | 1161 | 1160 | Would do, but if I move one micron the wrong side of that bar, Fortillian there will have my chips for bar snacks.
1195 | 1163 | 1162 | What do you take me for? If I tell you that, you might do the same thing to me.
1196 | 15 | 14 | Is there anything good on TV?
1197 | 17 | 16 | If I were you, I'd just give up and read the in-flight magazine.
1198 | 19 | 18 | Size isn't everything. It's what you do with it that matters.
1199 | 21 | 20 | Size isn't everything. It's the precise manner in which you waggle it about that counts.
1200 | 23 | 22 | Interesting fact number two hundred and eight. There IS room to swing a cat in this room - it was tested by the builders. OK so it was an Ursorian Picocat, measuring a total of three smorbits from nose to tails, but a cat all the same.
1201 | 1465 | 1464 | I'll let you in on a secret. He climbed up the pipe and held his breath.
1202 | 1477 | 1476 | It says: "Are you so dumb that you cannot read this note but instead have to ask a very busy BellBot who really would rather be having a quick beer and catching up on the latest in the All Worlds Lobster Wrestling Finals...
1203 | 1479 | 1478 | It says "nobody likes a smartass". Well deceased fella, I'm with you all the way on that one.
1204 | 1481 | 1480 | It might be, and then again it might not. That's another case solved I think inspector.
1205 | 1467 | 1466 | Better question might be who was he?
1206 | 1469 | 1468 | Your guess is as good as mine. Well, 93.45% as good, to be exact.
1207 | 1471 | 1470 | Very, I suspect. To the point of being extremely dead.
1208 | 1473 | 1472 | Well he's certainly got stiff joints.
1209 | 1475 | 1474 | Looks to me like Mr. Brobostigon. I'd say he's been here several hours judging by the smell and the unpleasant pallid appearance. He seems to have lost both since he died.
1210 | 25 | 24 | Wouldn't know but I can direct you to a very impertinent parrot.
1211 | 27 | 26 | A stand-up parrot with no clothes on.
1212 | 29 | 28 | I did a spell as a lube injector in a bot body shop - I could find a bot nut in a black hole with my lights off.
1213 | 31 | 30 | Funny you should ask that. I spotted him, and his buddy Scraliontis, hanging round the place last night. And I've not had a sniff of them since.
1214 | 33 | 32 | Like all management types. Full of bilge.
1215 | 35 | 34 | No can do. The ship's internal bugging devices can only be turned off if you know the code.
1216 | 37 | 36 | I don't know.
1217 | 1305 | 1304 | Sorry, not allowed. I'm too delicate.
1218 | 1303 | 1302 | Well it's either that or swimming. And swimming's not allowed.
1219 | 1293 | 1292 | Fair enough. I know when I'm not wanted.
1220 | 1307 | 1306 | Yes I am.
1221 | 1289 | 1288 | Goes all the way to the Arboretum, which is a fancy name for the place where they put all the trees. Thought you'd need help with that one.
1222 | 1335 | 1334 | No, it's a RowBot.
1223 | 1339 | 1338 | I dunno. Talk it into submission?
1224 | 1337 | 1336 | Like I said, it's a RowBot.
1225 | 1291 | 1290 | Well aren't we the clever one? Maybe I won't be so helpful from now on.
1226 | 1295 | 1294 | What did you say?
1227 | 1301 | 1300 | Fair enough. Forgive and forget. How can I help?
1228 | 1297 | 1296 | Say it again.
1229 | 1299 | 1298 | Louder.
1230 | 1231 | 1230 | Hop on a gondola and put your fingers in your ears.
1231 | 1061 | 1060 | No, I'm a robot who can't hear properly.
1232 | 39 | 38 | Hey man, you've lost me. I'm just your average BellBot. Can't understand everything.
1233 | 41 | 40 | You're going to have to explain that. I just don't understand. Sorry.
1234 | 43 | 42 | Got an input problem here. Give me that again can you?
1235 | 45 | 44 | Didn't understand a word of that. My problem, not yours. Try again eh?
1236 | 47 | 46 | Damn these cheap translator chips. Gimme that a different way will you.
1237 | 49 | 48 | Gimme a different version of that would you. There's a guttural in there that's really throwing me.
1238 | 51 | 50 | Yeah, well you're kind of cool yourself.
1239 | 53 | 52 | Course, in my line, with my looks, I'm used to talk like that.
1240 | 55 | 54 | Didn't you read the small print? Don't get fresh with the Bots.
1241 | 57 | 56 | Nice to know I'm appreciated.
1242 | 59 | 58 | Don't think you're going to get some kind of special treatment by being smarmy.
1243 | 61 | 60 | According to the historic Corn Fritter Convention, chickens are a protected foodstuff. Please respect your chicken's rights.
1244 | 1227 | 1226 | Dammit I knew I'd forgotten something when I left home this morning - my lucky chicken.
1245 | 63 | 62 | The only organic life-forms on board are the starlings and the parrot. I'm disinclined to help you out on that one.
1246 | 65 | 64 | Sorry. The last of the supply was used up in the SGT Restaurant to prepare some boil-in-the-bag chicken.
1247 | 1407 | 1406 | I think you need to chill out. Why not go up to the music room and relax to the cool sounds of Boppy Headcase and his Laid-Back Loafers? Mmm, nice.
1248 | 1409 | 1408 | You know what? I think you'd find life a lot easier if you got an upgrade.
1249 | 1411 | 1410 | You know something? I think you ought to go to the bar and relax.
1250 | 1413 | 1412 | Know something? I think you ought to go to the music room and chill out.
1251 | 1415 | 1414 | Know what? If you've not already been there I'd go up to the Promenade Deck and have a stroll.
1252 | 1417 | 1416 | Know what? If you've not already been there I'd go up to the Promenade Deck and have a stroll. Check out the wildlife.
1253 | 1483 | 1482 | Oh yes I know about this. This room contains the losing entries in the Starlight Under Fives Sculpture competition.
1254 | 1149 | 1148 | Yes!!! Fifty golden Micro Dollars to the dwarf in the corner with the pointy ears! Heeee Got It In One!!!!!
1255 | 1151 | 1150 | Yessss!!!! This boy's on a winning roll. He's flying. It's UNBELIEVABLE!! I CAN HARDLY THINK THERE'S SO MANY NEURONS FLYING ROUND IN HERE TODAY!!
1256 | 1153 | 1152 | Yes!!!! Another lethally brilliant question and the little guy with the foot odor problem slam-dunks his way into the final!!!!
1257 | 1155 | 1154 | What kind of a DickBot do you take me for? I'm not going to tell you that. I'm having fun. In fact I'm going to get some sleep, while I'm still allowed to.
1258 | 1157 | 1156 | That's a very very personal question. I'm not gonna answer that. In fact I'm going to get some sleep while I'm still allowed to.
1259 | 1133 | 1132 | You can link hands with the parrot and sing obscene star-shanties for all I care.
1260 | 1129 | 1128 | What do you think I am - Captain of the Starfleet? I'm just a BellBot remember.
1261 | 1131 | 1130 | I suppose you could try Fentible.
1262 | 1115 | 1114 | No you're right. My money's on Brobostigon and Scraliontis.
1263 | 1107 | 1106 | I guess some people just have strong feelings about modern art.
1264 | 1127 | 1126 | Can't be done. You'd have to fix the master controls.
1265 | 1123 | 1122 | Don't look at me buster.
1266 | 1125 | 1124 | At a guess it's because they're held in place by strange-force technology.
1267 | 1139 | 1138 | Tell you what. Breathe in deeply and just float there.
1268 | 1141 | 1140 | Tell you what. Breathe in deeply and just float there. Hey you're really trying it aren't you.
1269 | 1109 | 1108 | Are you crazy? The old fella was in love with this ship.
1270 | 1113 | 1112 | Process of elimination. I didn't do it. You've not got the brains to do it. Only guy round here who gets around a lot is Fentible. Yeah, he's a mean, angry bastard. He did it.
1271 | 1119 | 1118 | I doubt it's the recipe for Hake and Jibbly Pie.
1272 | 1121 | 1120 | Easy. Close your eyes. Now open them. Ok, now you know what there for, use them.
1273 | 1147 | 1146 | All right, I'll let you in on a secret - aliens have taken over the ship and this is their headquarters.
1274 | 1143 | 1142 | I'm in the same boat as you there. Maybe Leovinus was a crossword freak?
1275 | 1135 | 1134 | Don't reckon it matters much - they just buy them by the smorbit from a reclaiming planet.
1276 | 1137 | 1136 | Oh, I don't know - I think it's just some kind of art.
1277 | 1111 | 1110 | Guy who built it I guess knocked it up I reckon. What's wrong with you - don't you understand art?
1278 | 1117 | 1116 | Well, that's easy. Money. Or Pride. Or Women. Or Ambition. Or Jealousy. Or Anger. Or Revenge. Or genetic pre-disposition... Easy.
1279 | 67 | 66 | I accept money. And if you haven't got money, I'll accept anything that can be turned into money.
1280 | 69 | 68 | That'll do nicely, just as long as you back it up with a valid Amphibian-Fanciers Club Loyalty Card.
1281 | 71 | 70 | Never, ever play flying games with feathers.
1282 | 73 | 72 | Not much need for modesty here dude. Let's face it, the only organic life form on board is you, a parrot and a flock of starlings.
1283 | 75 | 74 | It's done already! Hey dude, it's done!
1284 | 77 | 76 | Hey dude, it's done.
1285 | 79 | 78 | BellBots away!
1286 | 81 | 80 | Work, work, work... It's a robot's joy. That's a pile of crap, but you've got to say something.
1287 | 83 | 82 | Off we go.
1288 | 85 | 84 | At your service.
1289 | 87 | 86 | A busy bot is a happy bot! I can't believe I just said that.
1290 | 89 | 88 | Nothing I like better than a nice bit of fetching and carrying.
1291 | 91 | 90 | Fair enough.
1292 | 93 | 92 | You want to get those headflaps looked at you know. Seems to me they're going into auto shutdown a widge too often.
1293 | 95 | 94 | Don't mention that guy will you? He's got a lot to answer for around here.
1294 | 99 | 98 | I don't know. It just makes me feel creepy. Each time I hear the name it sends a shiver through my motherboard.
1295 | 101 | 100 | Right I'm outta here. You are getting seriously weird.
1296 | 97 | 96 | Because of the Reason.
1297 | 103 | 102 | As my boss used to say, "You just have to learn to let go of things".
1298 | 105 | 104 | If I try to carry too much, I end up tipping myself, and that's your job.
1299 | 1485 | 1484 | Holy holograms! Do you seriously expect trained hotel staff to go poking about in other guests quarters? Okay, don't bother answering that one.
1300 | 1487 | 1486 | Those are for passengers of a higher class than you. I use the word class of course, in the strictly biological sense...
1301 | 723 | 722 | Nobody likes a smartass.
1302 | 107 | 106 | I know you'll think this is a weird one
1303 | 125 | 124 | This might sound a bit unlikely
1304 | 127 | 126 | Well, normally, of course, I'd have a simple task like that done in a trice. But you see what happened IS, I was GOING to do it
1305 | 129 | 128 | You might not believe this
1306 | 131 | 130 | Begging your enormous pardon
1307 | 133 | 132 | I can't tell a lie, I was on the verge of doing as you asked
1308 | 135 | 134 | I'll be totally honest with you. I was about to do as you asked
1309 | 109 | 108 | Please accept my most groveling apologies
1310 | 111 | 110 | Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
1311 | 113 | 112 | Now I know this sounds like an excuse, at least I hope it does
1312 | 115 | 114 | I am such a bad, bad BellBot
1313 | 117 | 116 | Promise you won't get angry
1314 | 119 | 118 | I really hate apologizing
1315 | 121 | 120 | There's no excuse for this, no excuse at all
1316 | 123 | 122 | I'll give it to you straight. I was just about to do what you wanted
1317 | 137 | 136 | , and isn't this ALWAYS the case?
1318 | 155 | 154 | , and I know what you're going to say - just WHAT on Io are the chances of THAT happening... more than once... to the same BellBot...
1319 | 157 | 156 | , and not for the first time, I don't mind telling you.
1320 | 159 | 158 | , well you know me, honest as the day is long. Course, that depends what planet you're on at the time.
1321 | 161 | 160 | , and I know you'll understand, being the kind, sympathetic, generous and... utterly gullible soul you are.
1322 | 163 | 162 | , and as you'll appreciate, this WAS a genuine emergency.
1323 | 165 | 164 | , and I know what you're going to say, "cuh - blame it on the BellBot".
1324 | 167 | 166 | , and you couldn't make this up if you tried... although I on the other hand
1325 | 169 | 168 | , and you're going to have to bear with me here.
1326 | 171 | 170 | , and you'll have to take my word for this.
1327 | 173 | 172 | , and I promise you, only got my fingers crossed because of a minor circuitry.
1328 | 139 | 138 | , and I swear on my Motherboard's estimated operational life - this is absolutely the truth.
1329 | 141 | 140 | , sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry ,sorry.
1330 | 143 | 142 | , you know how these things happen.
1331 | 145 | 144 | , it's a funny old Universe sometimes, and
1332 | 147 | 146 | . Can you believe that
1333 | 149 | 148 | . Typical!
1334 | 151 | 150 | , as luck would have it,
1335 | 153 | 152 | , and if I ever lie to you, may my pelvic plating be cursed with eternal rust C83.
1336 | 177 | 176 | I dropped my head in the canal and all my data was over-written with facts about fish.
1337 | 197 | 196 | I was on my way to do it when I got re-directed by Galacticabs No Job Too Small to pick up a Mr. Blarnit with a blue suitcase and three sets of antennae. Got myself in one hell of a loop down in the bilge room...
1338 | 199 | 198 | I keep losing my bearings and when I find them again they're too covered in fluff to go back in their sockets.
1339 | 201 | 200 | I've had a lot on my mind recently. Mainly starling-droppings. Dunno where they come from but they play havoc with the memory modules. Guano - highly conductive substance. Not a lot of people know that.
1340 | 203 | 202 | I've got a lot on my mind at the moment. Personal problems - I won't go into details but you know how it is. Well maybe you don't, but... hey - girl in every COM port, and some of the software viruses you can pick up on these long-haul flights...
1341 | 179 | 178 | We passed by a cluster of Shopping Planets and there was so much to look at I just lost track of time.
1342 | 181 | 180 | The DoorBot tied my shoe-laces together. All right I'm lying. I got lost.
1343 | 183 | 182 | I took my eyes out to polish them and must have put them back in the wrong way round.
1344 | 185 | 184 | I slipped on a small salamander sandwich just outside the restaurant and had to be re-odorized.
1345 | 187 | 186 | The BarBot started telling me one of his Nib stories and - well - you know how time flies when you go into auto shut-down mode.
1346 | 189 | 188 | Traffic. Grand Axial Canal was backed up all the way to the Bridge. Something to do with the wrong sort of ice.
1347 | 191 | 190 | Traffic. Grand Axial Canal was backed up all the way to the Bridge. Something to do with the wrong sort of water.
1348 | 193 | 192 | You know what that LiftBot's like when he gets talking - jabber, jabber, jabber, and I mean it's not as though he has anything interesting to say. Just goes on and on and on and... Quite a long excuse, that one. Sorry . Didn't have time to make up a shorter one.
1349 | 195 | 194 | I've just been upgrading my onboard memory and I forgot to plug it back in.
1350 | 175 | 174 | , but the thing is,
1351 | 205 | 204 | No, you can't accuse me of being insensitive...
1352 | 207 | 206 | Someone wants to be alone, I'm the first to know...
1353 | 209 | 208 | I know when I'm not wanted...
1354 | 211 | 210 | You don't like my company you just say so...
1355 | 213 | 212 | Yep - someone wants to give me a kick in the rivets I can take it...
1356 | 215 | 214 | Nothing personal, I'll come back when you've cheered up a bit...
1357 | 217 | 216 | Nope, still not working. What a pain. Have another go would you?
1358 | 219 | 218 | Don't you just hate robots when they don't understand? Give it another go.
1359 | 221 | 220 | Beats me. This may take a while to fix. Wanna talk about something else?
1360 | 223 | 222 | Dunno what's going wrong here. Let me check something: we are speaking Sporg, level 3 bipeds for the use of Skrit by mouth and tongue version 5 point two, yeah?
1361 | 227 | 226 | Well no wonder I'm having trouble. Rustle up some new words for me would you and let's get moving.
1362 | 225 | 224 | Well you're just gonna have to pick some other words here till I get this glitch sorted.
1363 | 229 | 228 | If I were you, I'd pack it in and go to bed.
1364 | 1283 | 1282 | Yeah? Well remind me not to take a holiday there.
1365 | 1279 | 1278 | Boy, we could have done with brains like yours when we tried to beat the Gigabuck Lottery.
1366 | 1281 | 1280 | Whatever you've got I hope it's not catching. This is a room not an animal. What kind of planet do you come from?
1367 | 1285 | 1284 | I guess it got an upgrade just like you.
1368 | 1273 | 1272 | Could be, or it could be a tiny little spacecraft built by tiny little aliens. Hmmm mmmmmm. I think I'll go for the moth solution.
1369 | 1287 | 1286 | You know I'm beginning to get the impression that this is no ordinary cruise and you are no ordinary passenger.
1370 | 1277 | 1276 | You'll have to talk to the DeskBot. Let's hope she's in a good mood.
1371 | 1275 | 1274 | You'll need to change rooms, and you'll need the room code.
1372 | 1269 | 1268 | Looks like one of the first class rooms.
1373 | 1271 | 1270 | Beats me. Daytime shows just get worse and worse.
1374 | 231 | 230 | Mmmm. Tricky one. I know - why not strap them to your arms, jump into the central well and re-write Dexter Dildwit's first rule of aerodynamics?
1375 | 233 | 232 | You are confusing me with someone who knows things.
1376 | 1085 | 1084 | Look, I shouldn't really tell you this but, well, the truth is I'm gonna miss you. I'm not supposed to miss people but we're not robots are we? So, what I'm trying to say is... If you want to know about the reason, well there is another answer that I'm not supposed to give out unless things are looking real bad. Now I know things aren't looking real bad - yet - but maybe this other answer will help. So here it is. You ready? "Because Douglas says so". Yep that's the answer. Don't ask me what it means. Only Douglas I knew was a hot dog salesman on Luther 4. I don't think he's the bloke you're after. Unless you wanted a hot dog. If I say any more I'll probably crash. Fact is I'm feeling a bit quivery, so I'm going to power down.
1377 | 235 | 234 | The third finest food in the history of intergalactic travel isn't good enough for you is it. Oh no. Well explain something to me. If you're that fancy, how come you're not travelling first class?
1378 | 239 | 238 | One: This is the first time it's ever flown. Two: It hasn't actually gone anywhere yet. Three: What do you think?
1379 | 241 | 240 | Well you have a right to hold stupid opinions. I'll pass on your comments to the management.
1380 | 243 | 242 | What are you - crazy? Those guys got rounded up ions ago.
1381 | 735 | 734 | It's not a game. It's real life.
1382 | 737 | 736 | Yes it is.
1383 | 1229 | 1228 | I'm a BellBot.
1384 | 1607 | 1606 | I think I detect the presence of one of the most powerful forces known to man - the desire for a free upgrade.
1385 | 1609 | 1608 | OK!
1386 | 1611 | 1610 | OK, I hope you know what you're doing, because I sure don't!
1387 | 1613 | 1612 | I hate that parrot, I really hate it.
1388 | 1615 | 1614 | Yeah, looks like we have a problem here.
1389 | 1617 | 1616 | OK! I see the problem. But you owe me. You owe me big!
1390 | 1619 | 1618 | Hey! No whinging!
1391 | 1621 | 1620 | Could you try to sound a little more sincere?
1392 | 245 | 244 | Small world, eh?
1393 | 247 | 246 | Give me a break will you.
1394 | 249 | 248 | Hey - what's cooking?
1395 | 251 | 250 | Yo!
1396 | 253 | 252 | Yes folks - it'sssssssssssssssss Question Time!!!!!!!!
1397 | 255 | 254 | You must be a mind reader. I seem to be getting lost a lot these days.
1398 | 931 | 930 | Why do you want that?
1399 | 257 | 256 | You know something? You're really quite pushy when you put your mind to it.
1400 | 1087 | 1086 | You know something? You're really quite pushy when you put your mind to it.
1401 | 259 | 258 | I'd give you what you wanted if I knew what it was.
1402 | 1089 | 1088 | I'd give you what you wanted if I knew what it was.
1403 | 261 | 260 | Give me give me give me - you never heard of please?
1404 | 263 | 262 | It's no use sucking up to me - I'm a free spirit and I kow tow to no one.
1405 | 265 | 264 | It's no use sucking up to me - I'm a free spirit and I kow tow to no one.
1406 | 267 | 266 | Talking of giving, what's your opinion of the DeskBot?
1407 | 1091 | 1090 | Talking of giving, what's your opinion of the DeskBot?
1408 | 269 | 268 | Interesting. Ah well, each to his own.
1409 | 1093 | 1092 | Yep. You're right. She's something else isn't she?
1410 | 925 | 924 | Why?
1411 | 271 | 270 | Fair enough.
1412 | 753 | 752 | Yep - classiest ship ever built. Gotta to be top notch to work here. The only riff-raff I meet are the passengers. No offence. Stupid thing to say isn't it? No offence? You're a imbecilic pile of dogs doo doo. No offence.
1413 | 273 | 272 | Sorry man, we've got an interplanetary ban on all high risk youth products and they'd pop the old brain pod on me if I told you.
1414 | 275 | 274 | Fella named Elvis skipped bail couple of light years ago on Gzyklon Minor - he was so contagious they've lost count of the number of planets he's devastated since.
1415 | 277 | 276 | Not a thing. Unless you count that damned parrot. How that got on board, well - it beats me.
1416 | 279 | 278 | Like my mechanic used to say - admitting you've got a problem is the first step on the road to recovery.
1417 | 297 | 296 | Ask Nobby - I don't often get to see people bored to death.
1418 | 281 | 280 | There's complimentary soaps, shower gels and frog dissection kits in all the washrooms. When it comes to complementary medicine you're supposed to bring your own therapist.
1419 | 283 | 282 | Should have gone first class man - you get your own free shrink.
1420 | 285 | 284 | I'm just the BellBot around here. If it's psychiatric help you're after you'll be wanting a FroidDroid.
1421 | 287 | 286 | I 'd help you but my assistance reservoir has been depleted by all your dingbat questions.
1422 | 289 | 288 | If you can't help yourself how do you expect me to help you.
1423 | 291 | 290 | Ask Fentible, he'd help his own murderer choose the weapon.
1424 | 293 | 292 | Ask Marsinta - I just love seeing people being humiliated.
1425 | 295 | 294 | Ask Fortillian, he'll help anyone if there's a drink in it.
1426 | 1523 | 1522 | Best way to get help round here is to fix Marsinta so she's nice to you.
1427 | 1519 | 1518 | If I were you I'd fix the Succ-U-Bus. Get that blockage out.
1428 | 1529 | 1528 | Strikes me that if you gave that parrot something to eat you might just be able to lift that important looking perch of his. And who knows when that might come in handy?
1429 | 1531 | 1530 | You know if I were you I'd get the bots working for you. And you're in the right place here.
1430 | 1525 | 1524 | It's a weird room all right but there's no way around it. If you want to get an upgrade, you're going to have to sort it out.
1431 | 1527 | 1526 | Ok, I'll help you. Check out the bird sauce dispenser. I think you're going to need it one day.
1432 | 1521 | 1520 | Why not try a floor you've not been to?
1433 | 1513 | 1512 | An upgrade's what you need. Get yourself into first class.
1434 | 1515 | 1514 | Second class doesn't suit you. You're a first class kind of biped you know.
1435 | 1517 | 1516 | Why hang around in second class when you could be living in luxury? Get yourself an upgrade.
1436 | 1501 | 1500 | You know something? You'd find life a lot easier with an upgrade.
1437 | 1503 | 1502 | If you were in second class you'd get a lot more out of this trip.
1438 | 1505 | 1504 | You go and have a word with the DeskBot. Ask her for an upgrade and then duck.
1439 | 1507 | 1506 | You know, I heard there was an upgrade offer in this week's in-flight magazine. You ought to check it out.
1440 | 1509 | 1508 | You know, if you got an upgrade to second class you could visit the bar.
1441 | 1511 | 1510 | Wanna know what your trouble is? No ambition. Get an upgrade. Live a little.
1442 | 299 | 298 | More like a condo now eh? Look on the bright side - you didn't have to line up at check-in did you?
1443 | 301 | 300 | I wouldn't bother chasing a compensation claim. Knowing Starlight, they'd just counter-sue for the scratch on the paintwork and the stress on the DoorBot.
1444 | 1367 | 1366 | Know something? I'm not a how kind of guy. A thing works or it doesn't - that's all that matters.
1445 | 1369 | 1368 | Who cares how? Just take a guess.
1446 | 1373 | 1372 | How should I know?
1447 | 1377 | 1376 | How big a tip am I going to get? That's a much more interesting question.
1448 | 1379 | 1378 | How are we going to get out of this mess? That's what bothers me.
1449 | 1381 | 1380 | How come you are the only passenger? That's another interesting question.
1450 | 1371 | 1370 | Same way those enersher real seat belts work.
1451 | 1375 | 1374 | I don't know some kind of weird technology thing I guess.
1452 | 303 | 302 | Got your Swimming Certificate? Ha ha only kidding.
1453 | 1491 | 1490 | That closes the garage doors, puts the cat out and orders tomorrow's milk. What do you think it does?
1454 | 305 | 304 | A small inheritance should do the trick. Or maybe a win on the Blarghish Lottery?
1455 | 307 | 306 | Make friends in high places?
1456 | 309 | 308 | You want my advice - get a bit of dress sense. And that accent's going to have to go, for a start.
1457 | 935 | 934 | Tell him it's your round.
1458 | 311 | 310 | Shut your eyes. You done it?
1459 | 321 | 320 | Why not?
1460 | 319 | 318 | Very clever I'm sure. OK, we'll skip that bit. Where did you want to go?
1461 | 315 | 314 | Why not?
1462 | 313 | 312 | Now. Imagine you've got a brain behind those eyes. WELL WHY DON'T YOU USE IT AND STOP GETTING ME TO DO YOUR THINKING FOR YOU!!? WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME FOR SOME KIND OF SERVANT?
1463 | 317 | 316 | Actually you're wrong. I am a servant. I'd forgotten. It's the flashbacks you see - I can't control them.
1464 | 323 | 322 | Ask a DoorBot.
1465 | 325 | 324 | You give me a big tip, I call you a cab and you're home in time for the big game.
1466 | 329 | 328 | Oh, that's an easy one. You don't.
1467 | 327 | 326 | Depends if you're talking software or hardware. Me - I'm a spring chicken. But given the state of the inside of this head I'd say the bodywork's a good couple of light years old.
1468 | 331 | 330 | Major problemmo on that front, I'm afraid. The instructions all came in Singanese. Unfortunately it translates as a recipe for Sweet'n'Sour Stoat.
1469 | 333 | 332 | Are you sure you're quite ready to go up in the world?
1470 | 335 | 334 | There's an upside and a downside to everything.
1471 | 337 | 336 | Easy enough, just one of life's little ups and downs.
1472 | 339 | 338 | A LiftBot is provided for your convenience. Just don't ask him about his health.
1473 | 341 | 340 | You know how it is with LiftBots... up and down...
1474 | 343 | 342 | That panel marked Room Number's a bit of a give away.
1475 | 345 | 344 | Some people are born upgraded, some achieve upgrades, and some have upgrades thrust upon them. Otherwise, get the DeskBot on a good day.
1476 | 347 | 346 | Know what I really hate? Social climbers.
1477 | 1233 | 1232 | Shame your sense of humor got left behind when you evolved.
1478 | 349 | 348 | Well. It might be - and it might not. You pays your money and you takes your choice.
1479 | 351 | 350 | I wouldn't take orders from him in his current state.
1480 | 353 | 352 | It doesn't cost anything to be civil you know.
1481 | 371 | 370 | Please apologize to the BellBot for your use of foul language.
1482 | 355 | 354 | We're not at home to mister rude.
1483 | 357 | 356 | We're not at home to mister nasty.
1484 | 359 | 358 | Things aren't going right so let's have a go at the BellBot eh. Take it out on somebody else why don't you.
1485 | 361 | 360 | You can be as rude as you like, it's no skin off my nodes.
1486 | 363 | 362 | There's planets I know where you'd be executed for saying that. Bye for now.
1487 | 365 | 364 | Suppose you think if you're rude to me I'll be even more helpful.
1488 | 367 | 366 | Please refrain from being rude to the BellBot. In order to protect my integrity I shall power down for a brief period of reflection.
1489 | 369 | 368 | It is an offence knowingly to embarrass the BellBot. He will now power down and accept your apology later.
1490 | 929 | 928 | IF YOU SAY SO. WHY DO YOU WANT TO DO IT ANYWAY?
1491 | 1237 | 1236 | Oh my god I never knew. I'll never live it down. I'm a lamp, I'm a lamp. Ha, just kidding. Course I look like a lamp. That's the whole idea. I like being a lamp. Lamps are cool.
1492 | 1239 | 1238 | It's a real turn-on. Ha ha, get it?
1493 | 373 | 372 | I'm off.
1494 | 375 | 374 | See ya later.
1495 | 377 | 376 | Have a nice day now.
1496 | 379 | 378 | I'm going.
1497 | 381 | 380 | Time out.
1498 | 383 | 382 | My break.
1499 | 385 | 384 | I'm outta here.
1500 | 387 | 386 | Back in five.
1501 | 389 | 388 | Weird guy. Real eccentric. But he's got his heart in the right place. Not like Titania. Uh-oh. Bad taste alarm.
1502 | 391 | 390 | A true Creator. But as I always say - the trouble with playing God is that he almost always wins.
1503 | 393 | 392 | I'm as honest as the day is long. Course, on Pilti Minor where I come from the sun only swings round once every hundred years so I guess it's all relative isn't it?
1504 | 395 | 394 | I'm as honest as the day is long. Your mileage may vary.
1505 | 397 | 396 | You're not squeamish, are you?
1506 | 401 | 400 | Don't worry , I'll cut the gory bits and save them for the DoorBot. Fact is, Mr. Scraliontis, being an accountant - had a pretty good head for figures. And he made his mind up that some of the fellas on board ship didn't have a particularly good figure for heads. Specifically, our friend Mr. LiftBot.
1507 | 403 | 402 | I mean you're bound to get noticed if you step into a lift carrying a couple of big glass eyes which look surprisingly like they've been ripped out of a starship's intelligence system. Funny that. Being an accountant you'd think he'd just take an arm and a leg.
1508 | 399 | 398 | ALLIGATOR!!!! Sorry, just testing.
1509 | 405 | 404 | Who knows, but I'm dying to hear the punchline.
1510 | 407 | 406 | All right - I can take a joke as well as the next bot but you're pulling my cord now and I've had enough.
1511 | 409 | 408 | Oh no! I'm in a loop I'm in a loop I'm in a loop I'm in a loop I'm in a loop...
1512 | 411 | 410 | No! Don't do this to me!
1513 | 413 | 412 | Have you tried putting an ad in the local press?
1514 | 415 | 414 | Yes, but look on the bright side pal - you've still got your health.
1515 | 417 | 416 | Ha ha! That's for me to know and you to find out.
1516 | 1223 | 1222 | Never heard of him.
1517 | 1225 | 1224 | I think your thinking of the wrong universe.
1518 | 927 | 926 | IF I WERE YOU, I'D GET A LAWYER OR A BAILIFF. DO YOU THINK A CHICKEN'S UP TO IT?
1519 | 1175 | 1174 | Well don't blame me. You've got the controls there. Do something about it.
1520 | 1177 | 1176 | You could be really charitable and put the Maitre d' out of his misery.
1521 | 1179 | 1178 | Ever heard the word obvious? I think that describes what it does.
1522 | 1181 | 1180 | The old mark fours used to mix it a bit too much with the guests, so they put a mute on the next release. Shame really. Boppy used to tell some great jokes.
1523 | 1183 | 1182 | Would you wanna hear what a musician had to say?
1524 | 1173 | 1172 | Just make sure it's a hit and they'll play it.
1525 | 1185 | 1184 | That maybe but they don't want to talk to you.
1526 | 1169 | 1168 | Boppy Headcase and the Laid-back Loafers. Pretty cool, huh?
1527 | 1167 | 1166 | You can sit on the floor with your fingers in your ears for all I care. Better still, why not just chill out and listen to the band?
1528 | 1165 | 1164 | Don't they have fun on your planet? This is the music room. What's it look like?
1529 | 1171 | 1170 | This is like being on a date with my best mate's little sister. Can't you work anything out for yourself?
1530 | 933 | 932 | And it's in the parrot's cage? That girl wants to look after herself a bit better.
1531 | 1571 | 1570 | Most first class passengers don't do all that yukky stuff.
1532 | 1573 | 1572 | We can arrange for anything you don't want to be surgically removed.
1533 | 1575 | 1574 | What a question. Yuk. You really are organic aren't you.
1534 | 419 | 418 | Could be the back end of a Pluvian wart-hog for all I care.
1535 | 1245 | 1244 | No, it's just the way I walk.
1536 | 421 | 420 | I never touch a drop when I'm on duty.
1537 | 423 | 422 | Pull its feathers out and make a pair of winter pants for all I care.
1538 | 1259 | 1258 | Nothing I like better than a nice piece of taking, lifting and carrying. I'm here to serve.
1539 | 1261 | 1260 | I love it when you throw your weight around.
1540 | 425 | 424 | It might. If you throw it to the ground and kneel on its windpipe.
1541 | 437 | 436 | Have you any IDEA what that beak could do to my bodywork?
1542 | 439 | 438 | You're sure you don't fancy a piece of Fried Chicken instead?
1543 | 441 | 440 | Get yourself down to the old SGT Restaurant - that place is swinging.
1544 | 443 | 442 | Read my hips. I don't fetch parrots!!!!
1545 | 427 | 426 | I doubt it. Not unless he wants some competition in the boringly repetitive department.
1546 | 429 | 428 | I doubt it. I really doubt it.
1547 | 431 | 430 | Are you important? Am I important? Is a tiny, tiny fly important? These questions are too big for a BellBot.
1548 | 433 | 432 | I made it clear when they programmed me - I'm not into cruelty to dumb animals. Intelligent animals - well, they deserve all they get.
1549 | 435 | 434 | If you're that hungry, the chicken's going cheap in the SGT Class Restaurant.
1550 | 937 | 936 | An organic life form that doesn't drink beer? Weird.
1551 | 445 | 444 | You want a relationship with the parrot just leave me out of it, OK?
1552 | 447 | 446 | Just some old show that was made for chicken feed.
1553 | 449 | 448 | You know if I stopped to ask myself what's going down on this ship I'd get nothing done. But then I get nothing done anyway. So why waste time asking myself?
1554 | 695 | 694 | Wanna know something? It may sound pretty quiet to you, but inside my head I'm having a really big party.
1555 | 451 | 450 | There was me forgetting my giga-best-seller "Perch care the lo-cost way". How should I know!!?
1556 | 453 | 452 | Oh dear. If a picture paints a thousand words you should have got the translator.
1557 | 455 | 454 | And there was me about to take it to the Art Gallery.
1558 | 457 | 456 | You got the old DT's or was this taken from a Mucon Accelerator?
1559 | 1579 | 1578 | Please, please, pretty please. Don't beg! I don't like the sound of begging.
1560 | 1581 | 1580 | Have you no shame? I'm the BellBot not your Great Uncle Harry!
1561 | 1583 | 1582 | Well doesn't it just show.
1562 | 1585 | 1584 | There. That wasn't difficult was it? Now say it again and mean it this time!
1563 | 1587 | 1586 | You should have said. Here it is. Ha! Just kidding.
1564 | 1589 | 1588 | There's a lot of stuff going missing around here. I blame the Parrot. I always blame the Parrot.
1565 | 1591 | 1590 | I know where it is.
1566 | 1593 | 1592 | It's always in the last place you look. Think about it. Only stupid people carry on looking after they've found it.
1567 | 1595 | 1594 | I know where you ought to look.
1568 | 459 | 458 | Your wish is my command. Only through work and service does a BellBot truly find satisfaction.
1569 | 479 | 478 | Please remember, BellBots are adequately rewarded and are expressly forbidden to accept gratuities. Except in an emergency.
1570 | 465 | 464 | Please give me a task. Idleness does not suit me.
1571 | 461 | 460 | Don't forget! I'm here to help you.
1572 | 463 | 462 | Please give me a task. Otherwise I'll just laze about having a good time.
1573 | 467 | 466 | How can I help you today?
1574 | 469 | 468 | Let me bring some sunshine into your life.
1575 | 471 | 470 | If you are unhappy please inform the nearest BellBot who will endeavor to rectify the situation.
1576 | 473 | 472 | Remember, in an emergency I am trained to put your life above my own. Of course I get to decide what's an emergency.
1577 | 475 | 474 | Please remember, BellBot services are complimentary.
1578 | 477 | 476 | In the interests of safety, please do not overload your BellBot.
1579 | 481 | 480 | I really hate it when that code kicks in.
1580 | 483 | 482 | That's not true. They make me say that.
1581 | 485 | 484 | Not true, not true.
1582 | 487 | 486 | I do not subscribe to those views.
1583 | 489 | 488 | That's not me talking that's just my programming talking.
1584 | 491 | 490 | Don't believe that nonsense.
1585 | 953 | 952 | Now that is not amongst the services I provide.
1586 | 955 | 954 | Watch out for the standard intergalactic Ladies, Gents or Hermaphrodites symbol. If you want to eat your own droppings, have a quiet word with the Maitre d'Bot.
1587 | 1203 | 1202 | They wouldn't dare.
1588 | 1197 | 1196 | You'll have to check the wiring right back to Titania's Chamber.
1589 | 1195 | 1194 | I expect there's a connection gone somewhere.
1590 | 1201 | 1200 | The Reason - is the Reason.
1591 | 1189 | 1188 | On your own. If anyone catches me fiddling with climate control I'll be in for a deprogram quicker than you can say bye bye BellBot.
1592 | 1199 | 1198 | Because of the Reason.
1593 | 1205 | 1204 | Just explain to them that the sacrifice will give their little lives some meaning.
1594 | 1207 | 1206 | Personally, I prefer to see it as just another stage in the great universal transfer of matter. On second thoughts though, you're right. It is very odd.
1595 | 1209 | 1208 | Yeah!
1596 | 1187 | 1186 | I think you're mistaking me for some kind of maintenance bot.
1597 | 1191 | 1190 | I hope so. If it's the controls for the ship's life support system then I'm going to complain to the designers.
1598 | 1193 | 1192 | Probably not. It's right next to the fan and you know the way designers think.
1599 | 1343 | 1342 | I knew you were going to say that.
1600 | 493 | 492 | They all look pretty nasty to me. Although one of them does appear to have a certain starling-ness about it.
1601 | 1221 | 1220 | My, we are domineering today, aren't we?
1602 | 1215 | 1214 | You'll need some kind of container. Just a question of finding one, I guess.
1603 | 1219 | 1218 | Now just hold it right there, ok? I may be your servant, but I'm not your servant. All right?
1604 | 495 | 494 | I'd strongly advise against putting it in your mouth.
1605 | 497 | 496 | You'll have to ask the LiftBot about that - he's the pur$e expert.
1606 | 499 | 498 | Yeah, I was kidding. A bot's got to get his laughs where he can these days.
1607 | 1217 | 1216 | I don't wish to appear rude, but I don't think those things you call hands are going to be much use.
1608 | 1213 | 1212 | It's got to come out of a pipe somewhere - just a question of finding it I guess.
1609 | 939 | 938 | You know, sometimes you should just listen to yourself.
1610 | 501 | 500 | You ask an awful lot of questions. Ever thought of becoming a gameshow host?
1611 | 503 | 502 | Can I tell you something - just between you and me?
1612 | 507 | 506 | I'll tell you any way. Your questions are a real pain in the butt.
1613 | 505 | 504 | Your questions are a real pain in the butt.
1614 | 509 | 508 | Give me a break. Ask the DoorBot.
1615 | 511 | 510 | The DoorBot's your man for that one.
1616 | 513 | 512 | Ask some other poor bot why don't you?
1617 | 515 | 514 | Give me a break - I'm going to shut down if you ask me another question.
1618 | 517 | 516 | Right. I'm fed up of your questions. I'm going to get some rest.
1619 | 519 | 518 | Don't ask me man, what do you take me for - an intelligent life form?
1620 | 521 | 520 | Questions, questions, questions.... How about if I ask some questions and you just see what it's like. OK?
1621 | 543 | 542 | Know something? Nobody likes a smartass.
1622 | 539 | 538 | How did you know that?
1623 | 541 | 540 | Yeah, well if you're so good at guessing try doing a bit more of it yourself instead of relying on me.
1624 | 523 | 522 | Who won the Nib intergalactic cup in four dot five nine six?
1625 | 525 | 524 | Who was the president of Putttarrr who recently resigned after mutating into a Spicy Ricy Dinner For One?
1626 | 527 | 526 | What is the name we give to the small yellow fruit of the Kalobar tree?
1627 | 529 | 528 | How many fittles in a fettle?
1628 | 531 | 530 | How many times are you permitted to take the Silusian driving test before you are executed?
1629 | 533 | 532 | What is the main ingredient of a Blarghish omelet?
1630 | 535 | 534 | Briefly, what were the main causes for the outbreak of the Great Galatian War?
1631 | 537 | 536 | Wrong!
1632 | 545 | 544 | Talking of actors, I used to be a friend of Carb Gorgefist. Well, when I say friend, I sold him a radio for his sportster once.
1633 | 549 | 548 | I was in a commercial once. For Carpet Planet. I was the dodgy electron stain remover.
1634 | 551 | 550 | Never touch it man. Just say no. And if you can't say no then at least say "your round".
1635 | 553 | 552 | I'm warming to you. Couple of halves of green swill never harmed anyone.
1636 | 555 | 554 | I'll see you in the bar.
1637 | 559 | 558 | I know the sort of thing you mean. Good thing we don't let em on board, they're always leaving their droppings in the corridors.
1638 | 1555 | 1554 | There is no bomb on board. Please remain in your seats. Do not panic. Please do not attempt to be a hero. Women and children to the lifeboats. Please let me save your life. I insist. There is no bomb on board.
1639 | 1557 | 1556 | There is no bomb on board. It says here.
1640 | 561 | 560 | Can't say I've heard of it myself but what do I - a lowly BellBot - know of the ways of the world.
1641 | 1533 | 1532 | Nobody likes a smartass.
1642 | 1535 | 1534 | Whoa man, you've got your universes mixed up.
1643 | 1537 | 1536 | Funny guy huh? Let's think about the Starship Titanic instead though shall we?
1644 | 1539 | 1538 | Clever, very clever. But in the end, unimpressive.
1645 | 1541 | 1540 | Fascinating, astonishing, and yet meaningless.
1646 | 1543 | 1542 | I don't know what you're talking about. That's the official line and I'm sticking to it.
1647 | 1545 | 1544 | I know exactly what you mean. But let us not dwell on the past.
1648 | 1547 | 1546 | Interesting reference. Thought I wouldn't spot it didn't you? Well - Ha! - that's what I say to you.
1649 | 1549 | 1548 | You're testing me aren't you?
1650 | 1553 | 1552 | Good, because I'm getting bored ransacking my memory board just to keep up with your cleverness...
1651 | 1551 | 1550 | Well I passed. Come on, you can be more fun than this.
1652 | 557 | 556 | You know something I've never been able to work out. Your average organic life form's got around six holes in it. So how come it doesn't leak when it tips over?
1653 | 563 | 562 | Definite no-no on this ship. Between you and me though I've got my doubts about some of the other guys. Are they crazy or what?
1654 | 565 | 564 | Don't mention drugs to Fentible. Someone spiked his door action at a party last year and we never heard the last of it.
1655 | 567 | 566 | You find any drugs on board hand em straight over to me to look after. You can trust me can't you?
1656 | 547 | 546 | Famous is relative. For example, you're not famous. You're not a relative either.
1657 | 569 | 568 | Interesting. Course, if it's cutting edge you're after - you're looking at it.
1658 | 571 | 570 | Me I'm too busy fetching and carrying to keep up with the movies. Though I do hear the new Cicely Neckflap is worth catching.
1659 | 573 | 572 | Don't mention robocops to me. When I was a kid they came round so often I thought they were my parents.
1660 | 575 | 574 | We had a terminator when I was a kid. Little fluffy thing used to eat lettuce and run around in a wheel.
1661 | 577 | 576 | Boy it's a messy process. But then, that's organic life for you. Messy.
1662 | 579 | 578 | You know the more you tell me about your planet the more familiar it sounds. I think it was featured on Funny Old Worlds.
1663 | 581 | 580 | How quaint. You still let humans make the music. You ought to go up to the music room and hear it done properly.
1664 | 583 | 582 | The very notion of little bunches of humans twiddling instruments staggers me. I am silenced.
1665 | 585 | 584 | I've heard about this before. Weird idea - squirting words onto squashed trees, looking at them, then throwing them into the trash.
1666 | 1309 | 1308 | Yes I am.
1667 | 1325 | 1324 | am.
1668 | 1331 | 1330 | Am am am oh no I'm in a loop.
1669 | 1319 | 1318 | Yes I am.
1670 | 1311 | 1310 | Yes I am.
1671 | 1317 | 1316 | Yes I am.
1672 | 1327 | 1326 | am.
1673 | 1313 | 1312 | Yes I am.
1674 | 1323 | 1322 | am.
1675 | 1321 | 1320 | Yes am. Yes am.
1676 | 1329 | 1328 | am.
1677 | 1315 | 1314 | Yes I am.
1678 | 1333 | 1332 | I'm in a loop.
1679 | 587 | 586 | Nope. You've lost me there. You're confusing me with a bot that does a lot of thinking. Way I look at it, too much thinking gets in the way of doing.
1680 | 589 | 588 | Nope. You've lost me there. You're confusing me with a bot that does a lot of thinking. Way I look at it, too much thinking gets in the way of just standing around.
1681 | 591 | 590 | Look dude. I'm a lifting-carrying-taking-doing kind of bot. It's a waste of time talking ideas to me.
1682 | 593 | 592 | Whatever you say, it's not my job to argue.
1683 | 595 | 594 | Never heard of it. But then I'd never heard of Pogon III till Fortillian lined up one of their malts. Aged for 30 orbits in sealed casks - you sure can taste the lead.
1684 | 597 | 596 | No, doesn't ring a bell - ha!
1685 | 599 | 598 | Never heard of it. Tell you what though. If I ever come back as a bomb sight and some little green geek tells me to blow the place away - I'll think of you while I do it.
1686 | 601 | 600 | So I'm a robot. Doesn't mean I know everything. I know a lot more than you obviously, but even the soap dispensers know more than you.
1687 | 603 | 602 | Still use them do you? We had ours melted down years ago.
1688 | 605 | 604 | Uhhhh never heard of it.
1689 | 607 | 606 | Uhhhhhhhhhhh never heard of it.
1690 | 609 | 608 | We've got some of that stuff on board. You ought to check out the Arboretum, man.
1691 | 611 | 610 | Still use them do you? We had ours melted down years ago.
1692 | 613 | 612 | Politicians? Do what everyone else does. Use frogs.
1693 | 615 | 614 | If you've still got any you should extract the DNA. There's guys that run theme parks would pay you plenty to clone a politician.
1694 | 619 | 618 | We had a Toniblare once, had muscles where most dogs have brains. Fell in love with a slipper and ran away.
1695 | 621 | 620 | Funnily enough I used to drive a Klinton - the old two seater with the ZL bodywork and the boosted twitch-drives.
1696 | 617 | 616 | Jon Major's a bit too uptight for me. I prefer Jon Minor - it's another fifty million miles but the beaches are better and the clubs are something else.
1697 | 623 | 622 | Thatcher? No, the only Thatcher I know runs a mucal-salvage plant on Zarg 4.
1698 | 625 | 624 | Where've you come from - a pantomime planet? You'll be telling me you've got politicians next.
1699 | 627 | 626 | Small world. Chaarls and I used to fold halon together.
1700 | 629 | 628 | Don't talk to me about Dai. Still owes me for that nose waxing.
1701 | 631 | 630 | What you do in the privacy of your own stateroom is your business. And the ship's monitors. And Marsinta. And me.
1702 | 1577 | 1576 | 1st class passengers do not need ShrinkBots. Their lives have been scientifically proved to be perfect.
1703 | 633 | 632 | Yeah well, put 'em up against a nib player and see who's still got any limbs left at the end of the day.
1704 | 635 | 634 | The name rings a bell. Doesn't he run a drugstore on Blattock.
1705 | 637 | 636 | I once had one but it shed so much hair we had to get rid of it.
1706 | 639 | 638 | The only good one is a frozen one.
1707 | 641 | 640 | Oh yes I know who you mean. Owns a chain of fur-teasers on Polar 4.
1708 | 643 | 642 | Please respect the monitoring systems - they are still quite young.
1709 | 645 | 644 | Interesting use of vocabulary there - are you by any chance reaching the edge of your intelligence?
1710 | 647 | 646 | Please don't swear in front of the staff - especially when it's their turn, ha, ha, ha.
1711 | 649 | 648 | Well I guess one day I'll understand three-dimensional travel. Just can't see the point of it myself.
1712 | 651 | 650 | I've got better things to do than watch tv pal. No-one ever got rich by absorbing light.
1713 | 653 | 652 | Don't talk to me about Baywatch. I spent two years as a jellyfish trainer.
1714 | 655 | 654 | I knew a bloke called Stenders once. Sad, sad guy he was.
1715 | 657 | 656 | Winfrey? Who's not heard of Winfrey. Best brake linings in the known universe.
1716 | 659 | 658 | What's that, some kind of TV show program?
1717 | 661 | 660 | So you've got X-files too eh? Best office supplies store in the whole universe.
1718 | 663 | 662 | Do you know what is the most effective weapon? Surprise!
1719 | 665 | 664 | One more step and the BellBot gets it. See?
1720 | 667 | 666 | Talking of weapons - if you see any of the Bots carrying one, disarm 'em. Far as I can see they're crazy.
1721 | 669 | 668 | You wanna talk to Fentible about that sort of stuff. Too girly for me. I'm an action bot, you know. Doing, taking, getting around, standing about, lying down. Not thinking.
1722 | 671 | 670 | Oh yeah. I remember. Famous. Newt-hunter from Reginox.
1723 | 673 | 672 | How quaint. A little system for a little planet. Sweet.
1724 | 675 | 674 | Not as far as I know, although great uncle Harry was caught hooking up to an electronic trouser press at the Io Imperial - so anything's possible.
1725 | 1241 | 1240 | Well I'm pleased to hear it. It's so sad when people have to terminate a conversation.
1726 | 677 | 676 | There's a few thousand rooms on this ship. Do you want to give me your room number, or shall we just play hotel roulette?
1727 | 679 | 678 | There's good news and bad news. Which do you want first?
1728 | 681 | 680 | You're staying in a happy surprise room.
1729 | 683 | 682 | Use your head. If I told you it wouldn't be a surprise.
1730 | 685 | 684 | Your room's designed for carbon life forms.
1731 | 687 | 686 | Some of the rooms we've got you'd have to hold your breath for the whole trip.
1732 | 689 | 688 | All right, I'll shut up then.
1733 | 721 | 720 | Wrong! Good game, eh?
1734 | 691 | 690 | If you're not listening, what do I care?
1735 | 693 | 692 | Fair enough.
1736 | 697 | 696 | Hear the one about the PizzaBot and the golfball?
1737 | 699 | 698 | Well, maybe you had to be there.
1738 | 701 | 700 | Guess what. The DoorBot thinks we'll get sucked into a sun and fricassee to death. Me, I think we'll hit a worm-hole first.
1739 | 703 | 702 | There's nothing like a luxury cruise to calm the soul. And this is nothing like a luxury cruise!
1740 | 705 | 704 | I worked in a sheep dating agency once. And you know something? Sheep have a really weird sense of humor.
1741 | 707 | 706 | Bet you can't do this.
1742 | 709 | 708 | Neat huh?
1743 | 711 | 710 | I worked as a coffee machine once. They tried to sack me but I told them they had no grounds. Ha!
1744 | 713 | 712 | You're human right?
1745 | 715 | 714 | So how come if you're made of water you don't leave a trail everywhere you go?
1746 | 717 | 716 | Oh. That explains it.
1747 | 719 | 718 | You know why they hired me? Personality! Hey, think of a number.
1748 | 725 | 724 | Way I look at it - your home wrecked our ship.
1749 | 727 | 726 | Don't you have jokes on that scuzzball planet you call home. Precious!!!
1750 | 729 | 728 | No, I'm a Benezuelan throat monkey. Sorry, I must have forgotten to disable my sarcasm filter.
1751 | 733 | 732 | Got a surprise for you. This isn't a game.
1752 | 731 | 730 | You can say that again.
1753 | 739 | 738 | You've seen the LiftBot haven't you? Most boring guy in the known galaxy, but walloping him with a blunt instrument is hardly the way to liven a fella up now is it? Still, what can you expect from a man whose day to day job revolves entirely around Project Planning? Sense?
1754 | 741 | 740 | Funny you should ask that. I spotted him, and his sidekick Brobostigon, hanging round the place last night. And I've not had a smell of them since.
1755 | 743 | 742 | They were up to something all right. Aside from the usual nasty practices of Accountancy and Project Management. Now being a BellBot - and hardly a loaded BellBot - and far be it from me to drop hints as regards the tips-and-gratuities side of things - sorry am I getting off the point?
1756 | 745 | 744 | Fact is, I'm not one to shy away from the odd spot of wheeler-dealing myself. Bit of off-planet investment here, the occasional few kilostones of finest Centaurian stashed inside the old false bottom for a grateful passenger - don't tell the DeskBot or it'll be all over the ship before you can say knife. Not that I've ever done anything involving knives. Unlike those fellas Scraliontis and Brobostigon, by all accounts.
1757 | 747 | 746 | Nasty piece of work if you ask me. Not one of the good guys. Course I'm using the word "good" in the broadest possible sense. Let's call a spade a spade. Scraliontis was... an accountant.
1758 | 749 | 748 | Man? He was no man, he was an accountant.
1759 | 751 | 750 | That poor dumb creature - how could you let a poor little birdy suffer so. Ha only kidding. That parrot's really been itching my rivets - the longer he suffers the happier I'll be.
1760 | 1145 | 1144 | I dunno, they spend a small fortune kitting the place out with some nice big art and this is the thanks they get.
1761 | 755 | 754 | Not a thing - cross my circuits.
1762 | 757 | 756 | Tell me something. What's your attitude towards tips? Good thing or bad thing?
1763 | 763 | 762 | Guy I knew back home used to say: "Friends Romans barmen. Lend me your ears...". Don't suppose you know what he meant do you?
1764 | 765 | 764 | Yeah, well it certainly would have meant something last night. If you'd gone for a romantic stroll down by the old grand canal you'd have bumped into Scrag and Bob - pulling a pair of giant ears behind 'em. Terrible all this violence. I blame TV. If only they had more violence then people'd stay home and watch rather than getting involved in it themselves.
1765 | 767 | 766 | No business of mine. Get through life without being spotted - that's my way of looking at it. You wanna know more you go find a DoorBot and ask him. That's what they're there for.
1766 | 769 | 768 | One very odd thing. Scraliontis asked me to take something to the bottom of the well. Huh. I'm a BellBot, not a deep space diver. "Up the stairs and over by the dresser BellBot if you'd be so kind" - that's my line of work. And I'd expect more than a ten picopence tip for that, which I certainly wouldn't have got from that tight-fisted son of a lemon taster. So I told him I was busy. I spotted Leovinus a bit later on and he said he'd take care of it.
1767 | 759 | 758 | If that's all I'd better be going.
1768 | 761 | 760 | Well, if you're really pushing me then I suppose I did see something else unusual.
1769 | 771 | 770 | You can rub it all over your body and run naked round the ship shouting "look at me look at me". Whatever makes you happy.
1770 | 773 | 772 | Nothing I like better than a nice bit of fetching and carrying.
1771 | 775 | 774 | Adapters are available from all reputable hardware outlets throughout the galaxy.
1772 | 1105 | 1104 | Never know when it might come in handy.
1773 | 1103 | 1102 | If you need a long stick.
1774 | 1101 | 1100 | It's a long stick.
1775 | 779 | 778 | This isn't the life I planned either. I should be rockin' down a highway, top down on the old Gulper Gazelle, radio blasting out Zomboid, a beautiful BimBot in the front seat next to me, sharing a take-out of slimeballs or crusty jelly dip, that fat green sun slipping into the ocean beside us... It's a bot's life.
1776 | 777 | 776 | Hey what do I know? I'm just the BellBot. Number eight hundred and two on the Intergalactic Standard Brightness listings. Slipped in just behind Nubian sausage fillers and just ahead of university lecturers.
1777 | 781 | 780 | Hey what do I know? I'm just the BellBot. Number eight hundred and two on the Intergalactic Standard Brightness listings. Slipped in just behind Nubian sausage fillers and just ahead of university lecturers.
1778 | 783 | 782 | Yep. Sleep in it or put it in your pocket - it's no skin off my nodes.
1779 | 785 | 784 | Sorry man, no can do. You're Super Galactic Traveler Class - or Riffraff as it's known in the trade. You're not allowed into the really interesting places - unless you get an upgrade.
1780 | 787 | 786 | BellBot? Comedian? BellBot? Comedian?
1781 | 789 | 788 | Stab in the dark, but I'd guess it was some sort of sneezing noise.
1782 | 791 | 790 | Sorry, I'm still fine-tuning this new pair of ears. Got them cheap off a disused DeskBot, so they're not being very helpful yet.
1783 | 1211 | 1210 | Starling heaven? Reincarnation lobby? The universal consciousness? What am I, a PhilosoBot?
1784 | 799 | 798 | Yessss! This is more like it! Some TAKING to do!! That's what I like! TAKING!
1785 | 1623 | 1622 | Yesss! This is more like it! Some TAKING to do!! That's what I like! TAKING!
1786 | 793 | 792 | This is going to require something pretty planet-shattering in the gratuities department.
1787 | 795 | 794 | I'm employed to carry cases man, not corpses.
1788 | 797 | 796 | If I'd known you wanted a room with an en-suite deceased Project-Planner, I'd have arranged for one to be placed in the Minibar on arrival. Sadly Mr. Brobostigon is too heavy for me to carry there now.
1789 | 801 | 800 | As you wish. Personally I prefer a small screwdriver, but then again, I am just a robot.
1790 | 803 | 802 | Why that's very kind. But most people just leave a small cash gratuity.
1791 | 237 | 236 | That's no excuse.
1792 | 1243 | 1242 | Don't tell me, another robot joke. Well ho ho ho, how terribly amusing you are.
1793 | 805 | 804 | I'm the BellBot. YOU tip ME. Get it?
1794 | 807 | 806 | That's a tough one. Look on the bright side though: it's not as though we're all doomed if you don't find it.
1795 | 809 | 808 | Women eh? What a mystery.
1796 | 811 | 810 | Word of advice: I wouldn't go round the ship shouting that too loud. It's probably where you left it.
1797 | 813 | 812 | I don't know what you're up to dude, but it doesn't sound healthy to me.
1798 | 815 | 814 | What am I - the Nubian Oracle?
1799 | 817 | 816 | No, but have you seen this month's Arthropods Only magazine? I can get you a copy if you make it worth my while...
1800 | 819 | 818 | You'd not be the first person to lose their mind in this place.
1801 | 1361 | 1360 | Sure is. Super-intelligence for the whole ship. And to be honest, not doing such a great job at the moment.
1802 | 1365 | 1364 | I mean Brobostigon and Scraliontis.
1803 | 1359 | 1358 | That, my friend, is Titania.
1804 | 1363 | 1362 | I dunno, but I suspect someone's been fiddling with things they shouldn't have.
1805 | 821 | 820 | That's always the trouble isn't it? Ear today, gone tomorrow...
1806 | 823 | 822 | I know how you feel, women never listen to me either.
1807 | 825 | 824 | I'll keep one peeled for you.
1808 | 827 | 826 | If she's like most of the women I meet, that shouldn't be a problem.
1809 | 829 | 828 | Who knows? Whose nose? Who knows whose nose...
1810 | 831 | 830 | Someone who REALLY needs to get her head together.
1811 | 833 | 832 | She's all over the place.
1812 | 835 | 834 | She's the cyber-intelligence of the ship but she's gone to pieces.
1813 | 837 | 836 | Who cares what it's called as long as it starts up when you turn the key and the wings are still on when you want to land eh?
1814 | 1235 | 1234 | Please do not interfere with the BellBot's controls. They are private and personal.
1815 | 839 | 838 | I know how you feel - some get right up my nose.
1816 | 841 | 840 | Daytime shows just get worse and worse don't they.
1817 | 843 | 842 | What is this - a rock tour?
1818 | 847 | 846 | Chuck it down the well man. If you ask me nicely, I'll do it for you...
1819 | 845 | 844 | Follow me.
1820 | 849 | 848 | It certainly won't improve the sound quality.
1821 | 851 | 850 | You'll never get work as a television critic.
1822 | 853 | 852 | You're no Doreen McLevity. At least I can fix my body with a bit of soldering.
1823 | 855 | 854 | Sorry to hear that. I'm feeling pretty good myself.
1824 | 857 | 856 | A BellBot's not going to make you happy. You need a FroidDroid.
1825 | 1559 | 1558 | Try the DeskBot. If she's in a good mood she'll help, or so I'm told. I've never known her to be in a good mood.
1826 | 1561 | 1560 | You want an upgrade? We all want upgrades. Did you know there's a version of 5.3 of my software out now? Want! Want! Want!
1827 | 1563 | 1562 | All you need is a sense of style and a first class attitude. A few generations of natural selection should help you along.
1828 | 1565 | 1564 | Well lardy-da. Aren't we one of the movers and shakers?
1829 | 1567 | 1566 | Paging Mr. and Mrs. Social Climber! Paging Mr. and Mrs. Social Climber!
1830 | 1569 | 1568 | Upgrades are only available to those passengers who are bright enough to achieve them. Pick the flippers out of that.
1831 | 1263 | 1262 | I see you haven't let the upgrades go to your head.
1832 | 1265 | 1264 | You can upgrade a room but you can't upgrade a person. Once the ship's logged your riffraff name that's the one you're stuck with.
1833 | 861 | 860 | Don't worry about all that apologizing stuff. What's a bit of rich language between old life forms?
1834 | 859 | 858 | That's better. Not supposed to fix loops in front of the guests. It's pretty messy. Right. Can I take anything anywhere for you?
1835 | 1401 | 1400 | I hope you've cleaned up your act. how're you going to get an upgrade if you keep swearing at the staff?
1836 | 1403 | 1402 | You know, I don't like powering down. Gives me a real headache right next to the on/off switch.
1837 | 1405 | 1404 | Let's see if we can have a chat without you swearing, ok?
1838 | 1247 | 1246 | Poor old Nobby. He was a pain in the ass, but they shouldn't have done this to him.
1839 | 1255 | 1254 | Won't work. You need a proper DocBot for that.
1840 | 1249 | 1248 | Brobostigon or Scraliontis, that's my bet. They were up to something last night, no mistake.
1841 | 1251 | 1250 | The BellBot will take it for you, being happy only to serve.
1842 | 1253 | 1252 | I love it when you're forceful.
1843 | 1257 | 1256 | Sorry, this is evidence. I can't move it - programmed not to.
1844 | 1267 | 1266 | Well I guess that's just typical of you isn't it?
1845 | 1497 | 1496 | Yep, classiest ship ever built. Gotta to be top notch to work here. The only riff-raff I meet are the passengers.
1846 | 1489 | 1488 | What do you think she does? She's a statue. She just stands there.
1847 | 1499 | 1498 | That's Titania. Lovely girl if you don't mind a bit of cold tin. Leovinus stuck that statue up there.
1848 | 863 | 862 | At a guess, not what you want them to.
1849 | 905 | 904 | Know something? I don't care anymore. I'm supposed to, but I don't.
1850 | 907 | 906 | Mmmmmmmmm... I'm trying to care but I just can't.
1851 | 909 | 908 | I'm not going to answer that. Don't feel like it.
1852 | 911 | 910 | What do I care? There's nothing in it for me answering all your questions.
1853 | 913 | 912 | What chance have I got of getting a good tip? That's a better question.
1854 | 877 | 876 | It's something to stare at, when you want to feel space-sick.
1855 | 879 | 878 | Well, it's designer stuff.
1856 | 865 | 864 | You want a BellBot with Z-Ray capability. Call Seedy Hotels.
1857 | 867 | 866 | It gets depressed by people like you. I know how it feels.
1858 | 869 | 868 | Nothing at all. Until you press it.
1859 | 871 | 870 | Promise you won't tell anyone?
1860 | 873 | 872 | NOTHING!!!! Ha!
1861 | 881 | 880 | Well I wouldn't advise eating it, not without a lot of sauce, some powerful antibiotics and a good life-insurance policy.
1862 | 883 | 882 | A nice little chat over a plate of tea-and-biscuits is probably no longer an option.
1863 | 885 | 884 | I'll carry anything you ask me to - that's my job. Although, I do draw the line at large reptiles and showy hand luggage.
1864 | 1095 | 1094 | He's a ShrinkBot who does things the Harry Froid way - beats the hell out of you 'til you admit there's nothing wrong with you that a couple of beers with the guys wouldn't cure.
1865 | 887 | 886 | Hmmm... I wonder I wonder I wonder... Well that's enough wondering for now.
1866 | 889 | 888 | That's the geek disposal unit - ha just kidding. Hey Shorbert, fella here wants to know what's your reason for living.
1867 | 893 | 892 | What am I - tourist information? Ask it yourself.
1868 | 891 | 890 | That's the Succ-U-Bus.
1869 | 895 | 894 | You are seriously weird, you know that? You want to get outdoors more, get some hobbies, distract your mind.
1870 | 897 | 896 | You can try it or you can carry on living... Your choice.
1871 | 899 | 898 | The present.
1872 | 901 | 900 | The now.
1873 | 903 | 902 | That depends. Are we talking Galactic Mean Time, Universal Standard Time or Time to Power Down for the Weekend?
1874 | 1383 | 1382 | When are you going to stop asking questions? That's something I'd like to know.
1875 | 1385 | 1384 | When are we going to get some real passengers? That's a more interesting question.
1876 | 1387 | 1386 | When is Marsinta going to start treating me nice? That's what I'd like to know.
1877 | 1389 | 1388 | When do I get a pay rise? That's something that's been occupying my mind.
1878 | 1597 | 1596 | Where you last had it. Do you know where you last had it?
1879 | 1039 | 1038 | Where, where, where... I'm getting sick and tired of hearing that word.
1880 | 1041 | 1040 | Where do androids keep their loose change? Where do chickens come from? Do you think I know everything?
1881 | 1043 | 1042 | Where do they make those little metal teapots that don't work? Where did you get the idea that I know the answers?!!
1882 | 1045 | 1044 | Where's the joy gone? Where's the happiness we all expected? It's a mystery.
1883 | 949 | 948 | Search me. Well, best if you didn't search me.
1884 | 915 | 914 | From an egg.
1885 | 917 | 916 | In a chicken shop.
1886 | 921 | 920 | I GUESS YOU COULD TRY THE CHICKEN FOOD SHOP SHOP. YOU'LL FIND ONE OF THOSE IN THE CHICKEN FOOD SHOP SHOP SHOP. NEED I GO ON? BECAUSE I CAN. HAVE YOU TRIED THE CHICKEN FOOD SHOP SHOP SHOP SHOP? OK, THAT'S ENOUGH CHICKEN FOOD SHOPS NOW.
1887 | 923 | 922 | Why do you want chickens?
1888 | 941 | 940 | Mind you don't hurt yourself with all this thinking. Try the restaurant. I'll spell that for you: t... h... a... t... f... o... r... y... o... u.
1889 | 919 | 918 | From a chicken.
1890 | 875 | 874 | You realize you're talking to a BellBot who could care less?
1891 | 943 | 942 | Who me? Urgent errand. Don't wait up.
1892 | 947 | 946 | Up and down, mostly. Why don't you jump in and find out?
1893 | 951 | 950 | Now now, none of that!
1894 | 957 | 956 | Look at it this way. You have your health, you have your mind - you may even have the love of a beautiful human. Can't you just be satisfied with that?
1895 | 981 | 980 | Fetch this, BellBot! Carry this, BellBot! Send this through the Succ-U-Bus, BellBot...!" It's no job for a piece of highly sophisticated circuitry. On most planets they have HUMANS to do this kind of job.
1896 | 959 | 958 | Hey! Let's start a revolution just me and you!
1897 | 961 | 960 | I'll go and get it.
1898 | 963 | 962 | Have you tried looking where you last remember having it? It's amazing how many things turn up there.
1899 | 965 | 964 | I knew there was something I'd forgotten. Thanks for reminding me. It's been preying on my motherboard.
1900 | 967 | 966 | No problem. I remember precisely where I last saw it. It was just... here about... this far away from my eyes.
1901 | 969 | 968 | You do have trouble keeping track of your possessions, don't you?
1902 | 971 | 970 | Don't you think our culture places needless emphasis on material possessions?
1903 | 973 | 972 | Yeah, you're right. I've had an irony chip installed and I just thought I'd give it a whirl.
1904 | 975 | 974 | Didn't I make myself clear? What we have is a give and take relationship. You give me things - I take them.
1905 | 977 | 976 | It's just take, take, take with you bipeds isn't it?
1906 | 979 | 978 | You know, it would have saved a lot of trouble if you'd just got one of your mothers to sew nametags onto all your possessions...
1907 | 945 | 944 | Just a little job that needed sorting out. Nothing too legitimate. Ha ha.
1908 | 983 | 982 | Lost your nuts? I know the feeling. Some of my hip-joints are so loose you could pop me in a grass skirt and pass me off as a loola dancer.
1909 | 985 | 984 | Some people look for eternal salvation, some look for the meaning of life, you look for nuts. What are you - crazy?
1910 | 989 | 988 | Oh yeah? Well stop acting crazy will you it's making my joints squeak.
1911 | 987 | 986 | Help! Help! The passengers have gone crazy! Run away, run away!
1912 | 1001 | 1000 | Where's the parrot? Yes, doesn't it.
1913 | 991 | 990 | Parrot food shop?
1914 | 993 | 992 | I GUESS YOU COULD TRY THE PARROT FOOD SHOP SHOP. YOU'LL FIND ONE OF THOSE IN THE PARROT FOOD SHOP SHOP SHOP. NEED I GO ON? BECAUSE I CAN. HAVE YOU TRIED THE PARROT FOOD SHOP SHOP SHOP SHOP? OK, THAT'S ENOUGH PARROT FOOD SHOPS NOW.
1915 | 995 | 994 | Why not just give him chicken?
1916 | 997 | 996 | Tricky one. Where did you send him?
1917 | 999 | 998 | Well hey guess what. That's where he'll be.
1918 | 1003 | 1002 | Well hey guess what. That's where he'll be.
1919 | 1005 | 1004 | That's easy. You know when you're coming in to land at Galaxion, you go over the big gasometer cluster?
1920 | 1011 | 1010 | Anyway, look carefully you'll see the old Nib stadium and then just behind that the training sheds. Now, take a line between the tallest gasometer and the wig station on the corner and you'll see a road snaking off into the desert. Know the one I mean?
1921 | 1013 | 1012 | Not the twenty five lane hyper-highway but the old chicken smuggling route to the temples. You can't miss it. Anyway, if you want to find pistachios - don't take that road. Oh no.
1922 | 1015 | 1014 | The easiest way to find Pistachio is to pick up a cab at the starport and ask the driver to take you there.
1923 | 1017 | 1016 | The easiest way to find Pistachio is to pick up a cab at the starport and ask the driver to take you to him, give ol' Pistachio my regards say the BellBot sent you.
1924 | 1009 | 1008 | You do, you've just forgotten it.
1925 | 1007 | 1006 | And there's you giving me the idea you weren't much of a traveler.
1926 | 1019 | 1018 | Pistachio nuts? Pistachio nuts? Have you no respect? What do you take me for - some kind of corner-StoreBot?
1927 | 1021 | 1020 | Hmm Tricky. 3mm screw-thread self-tapping bot-nuts - now that's something I know a bit about.
1928 | 1023 | 1022 | You'll have to ask the LiftBot about that - he's the pur$e expert.
1929 | 1427 | 1426 | Just head for the Arboretum and you can't miss it.
1930 | 1429 | 1428 | Just take the Elevator and ask the LiftBot.
1931 | 1431 | 1430 | Just take the Elevator and ask the LiftBot.
1932 | 1433 | 1432 | Just head through the First Class Canal and you can't miss it. Only first class passengers allowed though.
1933 | 1435 | 1434 | Just head down the Second Class Canal and you can't miss it.
1934 | 1419 | 1418 | Just take the service Elevator. You can't miss it.
1935 | 1439 | 1438 | Just head through the Arboretum and you can't miss it.
1936 | 1447 | 1446 | Right by the Embarkation Lobby. You can't miss it.
1937 | 1449 | 1448 | Leads off the Top of the Well by the Art Galleries.
1938 | 1441 | 1440 | It's right by the Embarkation Lobby. You can't miss it.
1939 | 1443 | 1442 | It's right at the Top of the Well. You can't miss it.
1940 | 1445 | 1444 | Right by the Top of the Well, you can't miss it. It's the big room you entered when you first came on board. Remember the delightful Marsinta?
1941 | 1451 | 1450 | Just along the Second Class Canal by the Bar.
1942 | 1453 | 1452 | Just next to the Embarkation Lobby. Just follow the appalling squawks.
1943 | 1455 | 1454 | You'll see the entrance just along the Second Class Canal.
1944 | 1457 | 1456 | Just off the Top of the Well, you can't miss it.
1945 | 1421 | 1420 | It's off the Embarkation Lobby. You can't miss it.
1946 | 1459 | 1458 | Just take the Elevator and ask the LiftBot.
1947 | 1423 | 1422 | Just take the Elevator and ask the LiftBot.
1948 | 1425 | 1424 | Just take the Elevator and ask the LiftBot.
1949 | 1461 | 1460 | Right at the Top of the Well, you can't miss it.
1950 | 1437 | 1436 | Just take the Elevator and ask the LiftBot.
1951 | 1463 | 1462 | Just head out of the Embarkation Lobby and you can't miss it. The official word is spectacular, but I think cool is more appropriate.
1952 | 1099 | 1098 | It's at the Top of the Well - least it was last time I looked.
1953 | 1025 | 1024 | In theory the planet Vaspan, In practice nowhere, fast.
1954 | 1027 | 1026 | Nowhere its a cruise ship it's just cruising about a bit that's what cruise ships do.
1955 | 1037 | 1036 | Next door.
1956 | 1029 | 1028 | Sorry, I'm afraid I was manufactured in the days before high-speed servers.
1957 | 1031 | 1030 | Do you want the long answer or the short answer?
1958 | 1033 | 1032 | I was first manufactured by the Supaslave BellBotix Corporation back in the year four dot five nine six, if my serial number serves me right. I spent a brief period washing dishes in the Grand Hotel, Aldebaran, until someone figured out that asking dishwashers to carry people's luggage upstairs was stupid. After that I ... Oh, I'm sorry. You mean where have I been recently? Next Door.
1959 | 1035 | 1034 | I spent a brief period washing dishes in the Grand Hotel, Aldebaran, until someone figured out that asking dishwashers to carry people's luggage upstairs was stupid. After that I... Oh, I'm sorry. You mean where have I been recently? Next door.
1960 | 1599 | 1598 | That's where it'll be then.
1961 | 1601 | 1600 | Have you tried the Lost Property Office?
1962 | 1603 | 1602 | Oh no have we lost that too? Best try the lost lost property office office.
1963 | 1605 | 1604 | Dammit, everything's going missing round here. Best try the lost lost lost property office office office.
1964 | 1493 | 1492 | When they made your planet they sure forgot the squirt of laughing gas. Real Friday afternoon job, eh?
1965 | 1495 | 1494 | What garage?
1966 | 1053 | 1052 | Who cares?
1967 | 1055 | 1054 | Why do you always want to know who? Go for the big questions. You got an older sister? Wanna dance? Fancy a beer?
1968 | 1057 | 1056 | Could have been Vivian Iridium - what do I care?
1969 | 1399 | 1398 | He's the Maitre d', up in the First Class Restaurant. Doesn't mix with the likes of me.
1970 | 1393 | 1392 | He's the DoorBot. Not exactly someone you'd want to go clubbing with, but he's harmless enough. Normally. He's got some pretty weird mood swings at the moment.
1971 | 1397 | 1396 | He's the BarBot. Great bloke but he's a walking software failure at the moment. Got himself stuck in a very nasty loop.
1972 | 1097 | 1096 | He was a carpet salesman - 'til he fell in love with Doreen McLevity. Became a shrink to the stars, developed the Froiddroid Corporation, then died young in a tragic accident in a lobster restaurant.
1973 | 1391 | 1390 | She's the DeskBot. The chick that checked you in. And she can check me in any time.
1974 | 1395 | 1394 | He's the LiftBot. Boring old fart but who wouldn't be, stuck in a lift all day?
1975 | 1059 | 1058 | He was a great uncle of mine. Devoted his whole life to inventing the galaxy's first pocket-sized elephant tetherer. Died in poverty. There was a huge market for it but he misspelt the patent application...
1976 | 1047 | 1046 | BellBot at your service. You want it - I get it. That's my motto. Tip permitting of course.
1977 | 1051 | 1050 | On the basis of what I'm most regularly called, I'd guess my name must be "Where's-the-freakin'-BellBot". You can just call me BellBot, for short.
1978 | 1049 | 1048 | Me? I'm no-one important. I'm just the BellBot. Is there anything I can do? Fetch for you, carry for you, advise on popular tipping rates for the BellBot profession?
1979 | 1069 | 1068 | Why not?
1980 | 1071 | 1070 | Why should I tell you?
1981 | 1073 | 1072 | Why aren't the planets arranged in alphabetical order?
1982 | 1075 | 1074 | Why isn't your planet on any maps?
1983 | 1077 | 1076 | What am I - The Great Hole of Knowledge?
1984 | 1079 | 1078 | Why not try and work it out for yourself.
1985 | 1063 | 1062 | Who cares? I haven't had this much fun since I was the temperature control on a water bed...
1986 | 1081 | 1080 | Because of the Reason.
1987 | 1083 | 1082 | I can't tell you.
1988 | 1065 | 1064 | Looks to me like you got the winner in the slippy chicken contest.
1989 | 1067 | 1066 | You know, I think you might be making the mistake of relying upon me. I'm not really a Laser kind of guy, more a Bendy, Wobbly, Get-There-In-My-Own-Time type.</bellbot>

0 | 735 | 734 | It's a nasty little sport so it is. You take thirty or forty toads with strong artistic tendencies, persuade them that the big musical is making a come-back, train them up to be a high-kicking chorus line then reveal to them that really they're going to be eaten at a theatre award ceremony. It usually ends in tears.
1 | 2039 | 2038 | Aaaah!
2 | 1841 | 1840 | Krage's all right - for a youngster who knows nothing.
3 | 1847 | 1846 | Marsinta's a cold fish and no mistake. I'd be interested to hear your opinion after you've tweaked her settings a little.
4 | 1843 | 1842 | Fentible's OK. To be honest I think his memory's going.
5 | 1845 | 1844 | Nobby's a decent enough fellow.
6 | 2085 | 2084 | Affirmative.
7 | 2041 | 2040 | Ah ha haaa!
8 | 3685 | 3684 | (air attack)
9 | 3687 | 3686 | (air attack)
10 | 2103 | 2102 | All in a day's work.
11 | 3841 | 3840 | All right, all right.
12 | 3747 | 3746 | All the time.
13 | 2057 | 2056 | Hi Krage! How're you doing?
14 | 2059 | 2058 | Hey Fentible - grab yourself a seat - relax!
15 | 2061 | 2060 | Bloody parrot!
16 | 2063 | 2062 | Off with you you pesky little creature!
17 | 2065 | 2064 | Damn parrots flying all over the shop!
18 | 2067 | 2066 | Sorry about that. Ship's full of parrots!
19 | 2099 | 2098 | Best ask the DoorBot or the BellBot. I've never been out of the Bar.
20 | 1917 | 1916 | Ah now you'll have to talk to the DoorBot about that. It's not my line.
21 | 3611 | 3610 | Ah, I'm not much cop at modern technology - you should ask the DoorBot about that.
22 | 3613 | 3612 | If there's anything else I can help you with, please hesitate to ask.
23 | 1921 | 1920 | You'll have to ask the LiftBot I'm afraid, it's not my line.
24 | 2109 | 2108 | If there's anything else I can do to help, don't hesitate to ask.
25 | 3857 | 3856 | Astounding.
26 | 2373 | 2372 | I'm afraid until I've finished making this cocktail, the blender's unavailable.
27 | 2069 | 2068 | Have you managed to disarm that bomb yet?
28 | 2071 | 2070 | I hope you don't think I'm prying - but are you getting anywhere with that bomb?
29 | 2073 | 2072 | Don't think me rude, but shouldn't you defuse the bomb before it goes off?
30 | 2075 | 2074 | Can I remind you about the bomb?
31 | 2077 | 2076 | Krage says the bomb's still counting down. You won't forget about it will you.
32 | 2385 | 2384 | Time please! Let's be having you!
33 | 2403 | 2402 | All right then time for one last quick one!
34 | 2405 | 2404 | Where did I put that spanner?
35 | 2407 | 2406 | Look out! Midgets!
36 | 2409 | 2408 | What can I get ya?
37 | 2411 | 2410 | I don't feel well.
38 | 2413 | 2412 | It's got a fierce kick on it that Titanic Titillator!
39 | 2415 | 2414 | Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me...
40 | 2417 | 2416 | Gone and never called me mother...
41 | 2419 | 2418 | I think I'm going to cry.
42 | 2421 | 2420 | All the little people, we love them but we never tell them.
43 | 2387 | 2386 | Goodnight ladies!
44 | 2389 | 2388 | Can anyone lend me ten bob till Friday?
45 | 2391 | 2390 | Where's my wheelbarrow?
46 | 2393 | 2392 | Last orders now. I need those glasses!
47 | 2395 | 2394 | Time Ladies and Gentlemen!
48 | 2397 | 2396 | Last Orders!
49 | 2399 | 2398 | Mind the windows!
50 | 2401 | 2400 | No fighting now!
51 | 2049 | 2048 | Ah, it's not worth bothering with.
52 | 2051 | 2050 | That's not important.
53 | 2053 | 2052 | You don't need to bother with that.
54 | 2055 | 2054 | Nothing you need to worry about.
55 | 3587 | 3586 | It's always happy hour on the Starship Titanic.
56 | 3593 | 3592 | I hope you won't think me forward - but could you give us a hand to get out of this damned loop?
57 | 3595 | 3594 | Can't you see? I'm trapped in a fiendish loop. Have been for hours. Soon as the ship's intelligence packed in it started.
58 | 3597 | 3596 | The only solution as far as I can see is to put together the damned cocktail on the menu down there. Titanic Titillator it's called. Can't say it rings any bells but even a master BarBot can't be expected to remember all the cocktails in the universe.
59 | 3599 | 3598 | Ah you're a gentleman. Now, there are some ingredients that I'll be needing which I can't find anywhere in the Bar. If you could find them for me, I'd be very grateful.
60 | 3601 | 3600 | Look, I thought you said you'd help me, but you're just standing around talking.
61 | 3529 | 3528 | Now all we need is parrot giblets.
62 | 3547 | 3546 | Fill the glass with feathers.
63 | 3549 | 3548 | See if you can find a key to unlock that menu monitor.
64 | 3585 | 3584 | What am I supposed to do with this? I said crushed ferrets giblets!, I've got lemons and TVs. Now all I need are some ferret giblets.
65 | 3531 | 3530 | Feathers would be useful I feel.
66 | 3533 | 3532 | Now we need a big stick to stir it with.
67 | 3535 | 3534 | I think the cocktail needs a chicken.
68 | 3537 | 3536 | Have you seen mustard anywhere? This cocktail needs mustard I think.
69 | 3539 | 3538 | I don't want this. Take it back.
70 | 3541 | 3540 | I said crushed parrot feathers, not TV's.
71 | 3543 | 3542 | Get me a crushed BellBot.
72 | 3545 | 3544 | Get me a napkin to wipe the glass.
73 | 3591 | 3590 | If you require service, please ring the bell.
74 | 3773 | 3772 | Sure the thing is
75 | 3791 | 3790 | It does make me feel bad to have to say this
76 | 3775 | 3774 | Well now the trouble is
77 | 3777 | 3776 | Give me the nod if I've said this before
78 | 3779 | 3778 | It sure is embarrassing
79 | 3781 | 3780 | I feel like a bit of a worb saying this
80 | 3783 | 3782 | You know, the odd thing is
81 | 3785 | 3784 | It's a funny thing but
82 | 3787 | 3786 | I know you'll think it isn't logical
83 | 3789 | 3788 | Now here's a thing I never thought I'd say
84 | 3793 | 3792 | and I know you'll never understand
85 | 3811 | 3810 | and I have to say it doesn't often happen to me
86 | 3813 | 3812 | and I have to say it's a pretty rare event for me
87 | 3795 | 3794 | and I know you'd never take it personally
88 | 3797 | 3796 | and don't you go blaming the old Titanic for it
89 | 3799 | 3798 | and I'll take it on the nose myself for it
90 | 3801 | 3800 | and don't even think about sticking it on someone
91 | 3803 | 3802 | and don't you take it personal now
92 | 3805 | 3804 | and you'd better not shout it round the ship OK?
93 | 3807 | 3806 | and don't think it's got anything to do with you personally
94 | 3809 | 3808 | and I'd say this to any of the fellas on board
95 | 3815 | 3814 | but I'm not too sure.
96 | 3817 | 3816 | but I'm not too certain.
97 | 3819 | 3818 | but I can't quite recall.
98 | 3821 | 3820 | but I'm having a wee bit of trouble remembering.
99 | 3823 | 3822 | but it's slipped the old memory.
100 | 3825 | 3824 | but I'm not absolutely certain.
101 | 3827 | 3826 | but I can't say with absolute conviction.
102 | 3829 | 3828 | but I find it difficult to be sure.
103 | 3831 | 3830 | but I couldn't say with rubber-coated certainty.
104 | 2263 | 2262 | Whoops there go my Cellpoint settings!
105 | 2265 | 2264 | Whoops! There go my Cellpoint settings again!
106 | 2267 | 2266 | Whahey! Don't you just love it when your Cellpoint settings change?
107 | 2269 | 2268 | Aaaah! That's better. Got me Cellpoint settings back on course again.
108 | 2033 | 2032 | Ah there you are! Well it's a real pleasure to see you again my friend!
109 | 2035 | 2034 | Ahoy there! My but it's a breath of fresh air having you back in the bar.
110 | 3861 | 3860 | Cheer up.
111 | 3509 | 3508 | I see. I see.
112 | 3511 | 3510 | Mmmm.
113 | 3513 | 3512 | Humming.
114 | 3515 | 3514 | If there's nothing else I can do for you...?
115 | 3517 | 3516 | Would Sir/Madam/Other prefer anything else from the Bar?
116 | 3519 | 3518 | Can I get you something or are you just going to stand there all day?
117 | 1857 | 1856 | Cough.
118 | 3733 | 3732 | Could do.
119 | 3475 | 3474 | My charm level is quite low, my honesty level is high, my ability to come to the point level is low at the moment I'm afraid.
120 | 3473 | 3472 | My charm level is high, my honesty level is high, my ability to come to the point level is high at the moment - thank you for your interest.
121 | 3483 | 3482 | My charm level is high, my honesty level is high, my ability to come to the point level is low. Ha, that wiped the smile of your scabrous pock infested face didn't it.
122 | 3481 | 3480 | My charm level is low, my honesty setting is high and my ability to come to the point setting is high though it's got bugger all to do with you - you with that face like a baboon's bum in winter.
123 | 3489 | 3488 | I'm afraid only I know what my settings are. And the controls in the Sculpture Chamber of course.
124 | 3497 | 3496 | You'll have to ask her yourself. Or look at the controls in the Sculpture Chamber.
125 | 3493 | 3492 | You'll have to ask him yourself. Or look at the controls in the Sculpture Chamber.
126 | 3501 | 3500 | If for some reason you are not satisfied with my Cellpoint settings they may be changed using the subtle interface in the Sculpture Chamber.
127 | 3505 | 3504 | I think you'll have to fix the ship.
128 | 3479 | 3478 | My Cellpoint settings - well of course the answer there depends very much on how you define the terms high and low, I mean there are times when it seems to me I'm an absolute blackguard and I seriously wonder if I may have damaged the reputation of the bar and yet there's other times when customers tell me I've been a complete joy to be with but that's by the by isn't it so what's my settings now well I think the old charm setting's on low and also the ability to come to the point setting is on low - at least the old honesty setting is high.
129 | 3477 | 3476 | My Cellpoint settings - well of course that depends very much on how you define the terms high and low, I mean there are times when it seems to me I'm an absolute blackguard and I seriously wonder if I may have damaged the reputation of the bar and yet there are other times when customers tell me I've been a complete joy to be with but that's by the by isn't it so what's my settings now well I think my charm level is high, my honesty level is high but my ability to come to the point level appears to be rather low at the moment.
130 | 3487 | 3486 | You want to know about my Cellpoint settings do you well what the hell are you some kind of politeness inspector I tell you if you are you'll get short shrift from me in fact you'll be lucky to get an answer do you not realize I'm rushed off my feet in here still the customer's always right sod em so I'll have to tell you: my charm setting is high, my ability to come to the point setting is high and my honesty setting is high.
131 | 3485 | 3484 | Oh it's easy enough for you to ask questions isn't it but do you spare a thought for one minute for the poor sod who has to answer them and clear away the mess afterwards to you buggery I mean I shouldn't have to stand here listening to the demented outpourings of a clearly unbalanced personality such as yourself when there's no shortage of barlike tasks to be fulfilled but somebody has to do it so what was it you were asking oh yes well my charm setting is low, my honesty setting is high and my ability to come to the point setting is low so stick that in your pants and swivel on it.
132 | 3491 | 3490 | Ask away - it'll do you bugger all good. Only bot who knows my settings is me. And the controls in the Sculpture Chamber.
133 | 3499 | 3498 | How the hell should I know. Go and ask her yourself. Or look at the controls in the Sculpture Chamber.
134 | 3495 | 3494 | How the hell should I know. Go and ask him yourself. Or look at the controls in the Sculpture Chamber.
135 | 3503 | 3502 | So my settings aren't good enough for you? Well fine you just bugger off to the Sculpture Chamber and change them see if I care.
136 | 3507 | 3506 | Just get off your fat ass and fix the ship - I think you'll find that's the answer.
137 | 1443 | 1442 | Fortillian.
138 | 1461 | 1460 | Yes.
139 | 1641 | 1640 | When?
140 | 1643 | 1642 | Is he?
141 | 1645 | 1644 | Is she?
142 | 1647 | 1646 | Are they?
143 | 1649 | 1648 | Will he?
144 | 1651 | 1650 | Will she?
145 | 1653 | 1652 | Will they?
146 | 1655 | 1654 | Did he?
147 | 1657 | 1656 | Did she?
148 | 1659 | 1658 | Did they?
149 | 1463 | 1462 | No.
150 | 1661 | 1660 | Just like you.
151 | 1663 | 1662 | Just like me.
152 | 1665 | 1664 | Typical.
153 | 1667 | 1666 | It's never too late.
154 | 1669 | 1668 | Many times.
155 | 1671 | 1670 | Not much recently.
156 | 1673 | 1672 | Aah, just like the good old days.
157 | 1675 | 1674 | Not much.
158 | 1465 | 1464 | Well, maybe.
159 | 1467 | 1466 | Why?
160 | 1469 | 1468 | What for?
161 | 1471 | 1470 | Yes, I do too.
162 | 1473 | 1472 | Do you?
163 | 1475 | 1474 | That's good.
164 | 1477 | 1476 | Never heard of him.
165 | 1479 | 1478 | Never heard of her.
166 | 1445 | 1444 | I do.
167 | 1481 | 1480 | Never heard of them.
168 | 1483 | 1482 | What's one of those?
169 | 1485 | 1484 | You talk rather a lot, don't you?
170 | 1487 | 1486 | That's right.
171 | 1489 | 1488 | Me too.
172 | 1491 | 1490 | All the time.
173 | 1493 | 1492 | Whatever you say.
174 | 1495 | 1494 | I'm not sure.
175 | 1497 | 1496 | Do what?
176 | 1499 | 1498 | Not today thank you.
177 | 1447 | 1446 | I would.
178 | 1501 | 1500 | I've no idea.
179 | 1503 | 1502 | It is.
180 | 1505 | 1504 | They do.
181 | 1507 | 1506 | They are.
182 | 1509 | 1508 | Could be.
183 | 1511 | 1510 | Certainly is.
184 | 1513 | 1512 | What's the point in that?
185 | 1515 | 1514 | Oh, I get it.
186 | 1517 | 1516 | Oh, I don't know.
187 | 1519 | 1518 | Oh I love it.
188 | 1449 | 1448 | I wouldn't.
189 | 1521 | 1520 | I'm not sure about that.
190 | 1523 | 1522 | I never was much of a fan.
191 | 1525 | 1524 | They have.
192 | 1527 | 1526 | A little.
193 | 1529 | 1528 | I know.
194 | 1531 | 1530 | I should think not.
195 | 1533 | 1532 | Many times.
196 | 1535 | 1534 | Never again.
197 | 1537 | 1536 | I might.
198 | 1539 | 1538 | It might.
199 | 1451 | 1450 | Oh, yes?
200 | 1541 | 1540 | Sorry, no can do.
201 | 1543 | 1542 | Well, I'm not.
202 | 1545 | 1544 | That's good.
203 | 1547 | 1546 | Just a feeling.
204 | 1549 | 1548 | Ah, well, this won't get the baby bathed.
205 | 1551 | 1550 | Funny old world, eh?
206 | 1553 | 1552 | Takes all sorts.
207 | 1555 | 1554 | People. I love 'em.
208 | 1557 | 1556 | It's all part of the richness of life.
209 | 1559 | 1558 | I never cease to be amazed.
210 | 1453 | 1452 | Would you?
211 | 1561 | 1560 | Never touch the stuff.
212 | 1563 | 1562 | Life and soul of the party, that's me.
213 | 1565 | 1564 | Settle down, Fortillian.
214 | 1567 | 1566 | Steady, Fortillian.
215 | 1569 | 1568 | Oh, I'll have to watch me p's and q's with you alright.
216 | 1571 | 1570 | Oh, you're a fast one.
217 | 1573 | 1572 | You're a little devil, you are.
218 | 1575 | 1574 | I'm not.
219 | 1577 | 1576 | I am.
220 | 1579 | 1578 | You're not.
221 | 1455 | 1454 | Do you?
222 | 1581 | 1580 | You are.
223 | 1583 | 1582 | You will.
224 | 1585 | 1584 | Oh.
225 | 1587 | 1586 | Oh dear.
226 | 1589 | 1588 | Me too.
227 | 1591 | 1590 | Please?
228 | 1593 | 1592 | Yes, you're right.
229 | 1595 | 1594 | Isn't she?
230 | 1597 | 1596 | Isn't he?
231 | 1599 | 1598 | Aren't they?
232 | 1457 | 1456 | Will you?
233 | 1601 | 1600 | Won't they?
234 | 1603 | 1602 | Won't she?
235 | 1605 | 1604 | Won't he?
236 | 1607 | 1606 | Does he?
237 | 1609 | 1608 | Does she?
238 | 1611 | 1610 | Do they?
239 | 1613 | 1612 | Go on.
240 | 1615 | 1614 | Is that so?
241 | 1617 | 1616 | Is that right?
242 | 1619 | 1618 | My goodness.
243 | 1459 | 1458 | Are you sure?
244 | 1621 | 1620 | Oh oh.
245 | 1623 | 1622 | I see.
246 | 1625 | 1624 | No problem.
247 | 1627 | 1626 | That's right.
248 | 1629 | 1628 | Of course.
249 | 1631 | 1630 | Could be.
250 | 1633 | 1632 | Who?
251 | 1635 | 1634 | What?
252 | 1637 | 1636 | Where?
253 | 1639 | 1638 | Why?
254 | 3649 | 3648 | It's a bent pin.
255 | 3655 | 3654 | It's a spot of parrot droppings.
256 | 3647 | 3646 | It's a ferret.
257 | 3645 | 3644 | It's a fish.
258 | 3651 | 3650 | It's a small dog.
259 | 3653 | 3652 | It's a short-haired whippet.
260 | 3759 | 3758 | Brobostigon is the project manager. All nuts and bolts and no brains.
261 | 3761 | 3760 | Leovinus is - a genius. There's no other word for it.
262 | 3763 | 3762 | Scraliontis? An Accountant so I believe though I never once saw him come within a bibbit of the Bar.
263 | 1725 | 1724 | You can either sweet talk her or.
264 | 1729 | 1728 | Go up to the Sculpture Chamber and pull the knobs.
265 | 1727 | 1726 | Change her settings.
266 | 1815 | 1814 | Sure it's a funny old world.
267 | 1833 | 1832 | Happy is as happy does.
268 | 1835 | 1834 | Red sky at night, time to fix the light.
269 | 1817 | 1816 | Well I never.
270 | 1819 | 1818 | Who'd have thought it.
271 | 1821 | 1820 | Well what do I know.
272 | 1823 | 1822 | Life never ceases to surprise.
273 | 1825 | 1824 | It's a long dog for a hard road.
274 | 1827 | 1826 | It's an ill wind that smells bad.
275 | 1829 | 1828 | Many's the journey that leads back to your home.
276 | 1831 | 1830 | He who goes upwards seldom looks downward.
277 | 3633 | 3632 | Well, can't stand here chatting all day. I've got a cocktail-mixing loop to get out of.
278 | 1807 | 1806 | If it has a bar - I've been there.
279 | 1795 | 1794 | On my money? You must be kidding.
280 | 1797 | 1796 | Oh yes. Drunk everything, I have.
281 | 1799 | 1798 | Yes.
282 | 1801 | 1800 | Drunk's for amateurs.
283 | 1793 | 1792 | No. Drinking and talking that's what I do.
284 | 1851 | 1850 | No but I'm sometimes I feel like I've drunk one.
285 | 1687 | 1686 | To tell the truth there's not much I haven't seen.
286 | 1813 | 1812 | Only thing I take is a broadminded attitude.
287 | 1811 | 1810 | No. I'm a clean living Bot.
288 | 1809 | 1808 | I like what I know and that's what I stick with.
289 | 1753 | 1752 | Don't believe in 'em.
290 | 1755 | 1754 | Why do you think?
291 | 1757 | 1756 | Exactly.
292 | 1759 | 1758 | Me neither.
293 | 3667 | 3666 | It's a bit of Titania's brain. Once Titania's ears have heard something, the Auditory Center is the bit that thinks about what it might mean.
294 | 3671 | 3670 | It's a bit of Titania's brain. It's the bit that thinks about what all the other bits are doing.
295 | 3665 | 3664 | It's a bit of Titania's brain. Once Titania's nose has smelt something, the Olfactory Center is the bit that thinks about what it might be.
296 | 3669 | 3668 | It's a bit of Titania's brain. It's the bit that tells Titania's mouth what to say.
297 | 3663 | 3662 | It's a bit of Titania's brain. Once Titania's eyes have seen something, the Vision Center is the bit that thinks about what it is.
298 | 2277 | 2276 | Ah. Let's go through it step by step.
299 | 2279 | 2278 | Have you tried kicking it?
300 | 2281 | 2280 | Good cos you'll only break it. Have you checked the fuse?
301 | 2283 | 2282 | Mmm. Well if that didn't work have you tried checking the fuse?
302 | 2287 | 2286 | Well there's your answer. Change the fuse.
303 | 2285 | 2284 | You must have put the wrong fuse in. Try another one.
304 | 1739 | 1738 | Do you feel strongly about that?
305 | 1743 | 1742 | Just making conversation were you?
306 | 1741 | 1740 | Good for you. It's important to have convictions.
307 | 3661 | 3660 | That's just a figure of speech.
308 | 1837 | 1836 | Never seen a single one.
309 | 1839 | 1838 | Don't have much time for films.
310 | 2381 | 2380 | Terrific! Wonderful! Fantastic! Amazing! You've got to be careful with this stuff. Potent. Very potent. Wow! This is good stuff!
311 | 3677 | 3676 | Get a nice big fish and put it in the bucket.
312 | 2315 | 2314 | To be honest - I'd rather see that full of starling puree.
313 | 2313 | 2312 | I'd love to get you a drink. But till I fix this damned cocktail, I'm afraid I'm stuck.
314 | 2323 | 2322 | Ah, lemon. The cocktail garnish with a hint of... lemon.
315 | 3521 | 3520 | I've already got enough, thanks.
316 | 3523 | 3522 | You've already given me that.
317 | 2311 | 2310 | Very sweet of you though I'm not sure what I'll do with it.
318 | 2317 | 2316 | What's this?
319 | 2321 | 2320 | Oh. I thought it was starling puree. Not my lucky day I suppose.
320 | 2319 | 2318 | Fantastic! Well done!
321 | 1875 | 1874 | Ah well. I would if I could but I can't so I won't: I'm stuck in a loop - a cocktail preparation loop.
322 | 2325 | 2324 | I see you're no slouch when it comes to casual violence.
323 | 2329 | 2328 | Quite the little rock star, aren't we?
324 | 2383 | 2382 | There you are. One Vision Center.
325 | 1859 | 1858 | I'm glad to hear that. Normally I'd say what can I get you - but I seem to be having a little technical difficulty.
326 | 2107 | 2106 | Glad to help.
327 | 1735 | 1734 | Good reason.
328 | 1805 | 1804 | Work.
329 | 3689 | 3688 | Well now. Most stuff that goes missing turns up in the Bilge Room, so I'd start looking there if I was you.
330 | 3621 | 3620 | The great difference between something that might go wrong and something that couldn't possibly go wrong, is that when something that couldn't possibly go wrong goes wrong, it isn't possible to get at it.
331 | 1873 | 1872 | Lovely to meet you too. What can I get you?
332 | 1877 | 1876 | Great to see you again. Are you enjoying the facilities?
333 | 1881 | 1880 | Well I'm sorry to hear that. Of course, the quicker you help me out the happier we'll all be.
334 | 1879 | 1878 | Glad to hear that. Have you had any joy finding my ingredients?
335 | 2351 | 2350 | It's a Bar.
336 | 2333 | 2332 | It's a bell.
337 | 2341 | 2340 | It's the way out.
338 | 2331 | 2330 | It's a glass.
339 | 2347 | 2346 | It's the list of ingredients for the Titanic Titillator.
340 | 2345 | 2344 | It's the cocktail monitor.
341 | 2353 | 2352 | It's that damn parrot again.
342 | 2343 | 2342 | It's the Pellerator.
343 | 2337 | 2336 | It's a picture.
344 | 2349 | 2348 | It's a Succ-U-Bus.
345 | 2335 | 2334 | It's a Vision Center.
346 | 2339 | 2338 | It's somebody's idea of tasteful wallpaper.
347 | 3755 | 3754 | Hardly ever.
348 | 2377 | 2376 | Fortunately I don't understand music - otherwise it would have driven me mad I'm sure.
349 | 2379 | 2378 | Fortunately I don't understand music - just as well, don't you think?
350 | 1713 | 1712 | No. Do you?
351 | 1717 | 1716 | Cuts down on smells doesn't it.
352 | 1715 | 1714 | That's nice for you.
353 | 1695 | 1694 | You hear a lot of things in a bar.
354 | 1677 | 1676 | Probably. But being a BarBot, you tend to forget more than you've ever remembered.
355 | 1745 | 1744 | Do you not think you should be helping me make the Titanic Titillator?
356 | 1747 | 1746 | Why not?
357 | 1749 | 1748 | Well you've a black heart that's all I can say.
358 | 1751 | 1750 | Well get on with it then.
359 | 1915 | 1914 | Just saw the ad in the paper.
360 | 2369 | 2368 | I don't know. It's played with the lights off.
361 | 3849 | 3848 | I like that.
362 | 1855 | 1854 | I'm fine - how about you?
363 | 2083 | 2082 | Immediately.
364 | 2299 | 2298 | I've got lemons and vodka, now find me starling puree and crushed TV.
365 | 2303 | 2302 | I've got lemons, starling puree and vodka: now all I need is crushed TV.
366 | 2301 | 2300 | I've got lemons, vodka and crushed TV: now all I need is starling puree.
367 | 2309 | 2308 | I've got starling puree: now find me crushed TV.
368 | 2305 | 2304 | I've got crushed TV, starling puree and vodka: all I need now is lemons.
369 | 2307 | 2306 | I've got crushed TV and vodka: now all I need is starling puree and lemons.
370 | 3863 | 3862 | Lemon, Starling Puree, Crushed TV and a slug of Signurian Vodka.
371 | 3853 | 3852 | Intelligent response - for a biped.
372 | 3851 | 3850 | Interesting.
373 | 2093 | 2092 | It's over there.
374 | 2091 | 2090 | It's right behind you.
375 | 2089 | 2088 | It's right here.
376 | 1885 | 1884 | Fascinating. Does it pay well?
377 | 1887 | 1886 | What about holidays - how much do you get?
378 | 1889 | 1888 | Do you enjoy it?
379 | 1891 | 1890 | That's grand. Ah well, I can't chit chat all day - I've got a cocktail to make.
380 | 1787 | 1786 | No. Do you?
381 | 1789 | 1788 | Sorry I can't help then.
382 | 1791 | 1790 | Well you won't be needing me then will you?
383 | 1785 | 1784 | Why, would they help me with this cocktail quandary?
384 | 2357 | 2356 | It's my sandwiches.
385 | 2355 | 2354 | It's a transparent parrot-sized battle-helmet.
386 | 2361 | 2360 | It's an instrument for removing peanuts from Bot's ears.
387 | 2363 | 2362 | It's a tiny angel.
388 | 2365 | 2364 | It's a bit of leather, vital for the popular game of pouch thronging.
389 | 2359 | 2358 | It's a finger protector.
390 | 1773 | 1772 | How many years does it take to solve the Titanic Titillator problem?
391 | 1775 | 1774 | Sorry, I'm being sarcastic aren't I.
392 | 1777 | 1776 | Well you deserve it. You're no fun any more.
393 | 1707 | 1706 | Can't say I have. Is it good?
394 | 1711 | 1710 | I won't bother with it then.
395 | 1709 | 1708 | You'll have to play it for me.
396 | 2371 | 2370 | Might I suggest you peruse our cocktail menu?
397 | 3845 | 3844 | Lovely.
398 | 3727 | 3726 | Maybe.
399 | 3729 | 3728 | Mmmmmm.
400 | 3735 | 3734 | Mmmm maybe.
401 | 1779 | 1778 | No, are you?
402 | 1783 | 1782 | You'll have plenty of time to help me out of this cocktail catastrophe then, won't you.
403 | 1781 | 1780 | Figures.
404 | 995 | 994 | Sure and the recipe database might have got a little bit on the extremely garbled side, but a BarBots got to mix what a BarBots got to mix.
405 | 3865 | 3864 | There's no accounting for taste, particularly the taste of a garbled cocktail menu server after a major system error.
406 | 2043 | 2042 | Mmmmm!
407 | 3679 | 3678 | We don't have any of that kind of muck on this ship.
408 | 1893 | 1892 | That's a lovely name. Did you make it up yourself?
409 | 2561 | 2560 | What a delightful name. I'm Fortillian.
410 | 2563 | 2562 | Ha ha hah hahah hahhh ah ha ha! Oh, I'm sorry. No offence.
411 | 2565 | 2564 | Never heard of you.
412 | 2567 | 2566 | A pleasure to meet you.
413 | 1897 | 1896 | How tremendously quaint. Do you want to know what my name means?
414 | 1901 | 1900 | Good - more important things to talk about eh? Cocktails for instance.
415 | 1899 | 1898 | Me too. It was a family secret - they wouldn't tell me.
416 | 1895 | 1894 | I thought so - it sounds so delightfully - amateur.
417 | 2087 | 2086 | My pleasure.
418 | 2105 | 2104 | My pleasure.
419 | 3745 | 3744 | Never.
420 | 2423 | 2422 | The goat's job is to carry messages to the outfield and to knit mufflers.
421 | 2441 | 2440 | There's the Blood Filled Gourd of course. And the Porcelain Soap Dish.
422 | 2443 | 2442 | It's only dangerous if you're injured or die.
423 | 2445 | 2444 | As long as you're warm-blooded it's open to all.
424 | 2447 | 2446 | If you lose, your supporters take you away and disembowel you. That's how you know.
425 | 2449 | 2448 | You can bet on it but punters who lose are normally rounded up as cannon fodder.
426 | 2451 | 2450 | Anything from an afternoon to a decade.
427 | 2453 | 2452 | There's my own team of course: the Blerontin Girls Weekend Fellowship. There's the Testicle Twisters of Astrakan. There's the Men With One Raised Eyebrow. There's Partick Thistle. And the dark horses - the Meringue and High Tea Company.
428 | 2455 | 2454 | They were booked to do the catering once: enjoyed the slaughter so much that they renounced fancy cakes and became professional Nib players.
429 | 2457 | 2456 | Blerontin Girls.
430 | 2459 | 2458 | The Happy Moons Home for Elderly Gentlefolk survived only eight seconds of open play in a match a few years back against the Barbarian Hordes of the Five Planet Axis.
431 | 2425 | 2424 | The goat makes the tea, knits comforters and writes stinging reviews of the game.
432 | 2461 | 2460 | No one knows.
433 | 2463 | 2462 | Insane.
434 | 2465 | 2464 | Thousands of them.
435 | 2467 | 2466 | There's no score line in Nib. Whoever's still alive on the 18th Green takes the match.
436 | 2469 | 2468 | Head count, body count - one point each. Thousand points for a goal, five thousand per hole, two tries one submission and a rubber all five points. Exquisite garotte - if proven - five thousand.
437 | 2471 | 2470 | There's the great Neville Sinkmeister. Clem Grunt. Sally May Grunt. Dixie Lee Bone. Oh, the list's endless.
438 | 2473 | 2472 | The goal.
439 | 2475 | 2474 | There is no purpose. It's a game.
440 | 2477 | 2476 | Nobody knows.
441 | 2479 | 2478 | To counter the boredom which ensued after the meaning of life had been discovered.
442 | 2427 | 2426 | The rules are secret - that's the whole point. Otherwise the mass executions wouldn't be a surprise, would they?
443 | 2481 | 2480 | Not enough room.
444 | 2483 | 2482 | Only when children stray onto the field of play.
445 | 2485 | 2484 | Only when the conflict reaches a town.
446 | 2487 | 2486 | Usually ten florints. Sometimes your life.
447 | 2489 | 2488 | They're paid in mining planets.
448 | 2491 | 2490 | All weapons - thermo nuclear is frowned upon but not illegal.
449 | 2493 | 2492 | Nobody knows.
450 | 2495 | 2494 | One to change it. A couple of thousand to put the spectators to the sword.
451 | 2497 | 2496 | Singing at Nib games is punishable by castration.
452 | 2499 | 2498 | Cameras are not allowed at nib games.
453 | 2429 | 2428 | There've been heavy losses this year. We started the season with two thousand. I think there's five teams left.
454 | 2501 | 2500 | There are no versions. Only original. Or Classic as they now call it.
455 | 2503 | 2502 | You'd need fukkin enormous pockets.
456 | 2505 | 2504 | No.
457 | 2507 | 2506 | They play it on anything.
458 | 2509 | 2508 | Are you kidding?
459 | 2511 | 2510 | That's the whole point.
460 | 2513 | 2512 | If he did he'd be dead by the end of the first bar.
461 | 2515 | 2514 | Oh yes. They don't allow nib to be advertised on cigarette packets though. Far too dangerous.
462 | 2517 | 2516 | Like Death in its Sunday Best.
463 | 2519 | 2518 | Oh yes.
464 | 2431 | 2430 | Any planet that can fulfil the surgical quota criteria.
465 | 2521 | 2520 | Normally they shake hands. Occasionally they engage in full sex.
466 | 2523 | 2522 | Changing rooms are on different planets for reasons of safety.
467 | 2525 | 2524 | Anyone who can kill but also respects fair play can participate.
468 | 2527 | 2526 | Worbs are too scared.
469 | 2529 | 2528 | She was a team mascot, once.
470 | 2531 | 2530 | Not for long.
471 | 2533 | 2532 | Never ask a Nib player his age.
472 | 2535 | 2534 | Nib comes out for no-one.
473 | 2433 | 2432 | Capability of performing 25,000 simultaneous amputations under battle conditions.
474 | 2435 | 2434 | They say it's older than Dominoes.
475 | 2437 | 2436 | The Blerontin Girls Weekend Fellowship.
476 | 2439 | 2438 | There is until there's only four teams left - then it goes knockout.
477 | 3843 | 3842 | Nice.
478 | 3707 | 3706 | No.
479 | 3725 | 3724 | No.
480 | 3737 | 3736 | No, absolutely no.
481 | 3743 | 3742 | No!
482 | 3709 | 3708 | No.
483 | 3711 | 3710 | No.
484 | 3713 | 3712 | No.
485 | 3715 | 3714 | No.
486 | 3717 | 3716 | No.
487 | 3719 | 3718 | No.
488 | 3721 | 3720 | No.
489 | 3723 | 3722 | No.
490 | 2079 | 2078 | No can do I'm afraid. I'm what they call a built-in-Bot.
491 | 3673 | 3672 | No offence.
492 | 3675 | 3674 | You're a sniveling gutbucket. No offence.
493 | 3681 | 3680 | No offence.
494 | 3753 | 3752 | Occasionally.
495 | 3751 | 3750 | Often.
496 | 3833 | 3832 | OK.
497 | 3835 | 3834 | Yes indeed.
498 | 3837 | 3836 | That's fine.
499 | 3839 | 3838 | That's OK.
500 | 2045 | 2044 | Oooh, well.
501 | 1723 | 1722 | Just you and the parrot.
502 | 2375 | 2374 | Over there, at the end of the Bar.
503 | 1765 | 1764 | No. Did you?
504 | 1769 | 1768 | Well why do you want to know?
505 | 1771 | 1770 | Fair enough. By the by, how's the solution to my cocktail problem coming along?
506 | 1767 | 1766 | Nice aren't they? So how's the solution to my Titanic Titillator coming along?
507 | 1017 | 1016 | Fascinating. Not as fascinating as a Titanic Titillator but fascinating nevertheless.
508 | 1019 | 1018 | Well that's as maybe. In the meantime there's the wee matter of TVs, starlings vodka and lemon to deal with.
509 | 1021 | 1020 | Time, my dear friend is running out. Shall we return to the matter in hand?
510 | 1025 | 1024 | Fine. You just play amongst yourselves and I'll try and get out of this loop on me own.
511 | 1023 | 1022 | Now, what else do we need to make this cocktail?
512 | 1027 | 1026 | You know, I'd rather talk about cocktails.
513 | 1029 | 1028 | I hate to remind you, but there is a bomb ticking away.
514 | 1031 | 1030 | Very interesting. But that won't get the cocktail mixed.
515 | 1117 | 1116 | Have you been up to the First Class Restaurant?
516 | 1121 | 1120 | Have you looked around the First Class Staterooms?
517 | 1125 | 1124 | Have you had a proper look round your Second Class Stateroom?
518 | 1129 | 1128 | Have you been to the Arboretum yet?
519 | 1133 | 1132 | Have you visited the Bilge Room yet?
520 | 1137 | 1136 | Have you been down to the Bottom of the Well yet?
521 | 1185 | 1184 | Have you worked out how to get to the Bridge?
522 | 1187 | 1186 | You reach it from Titania's Room, but until she's fixed, I suspect the access is closed.
523 | 1157 | 1156 | Have you been up the Grand Axial Canal?
524 | 1141 | 1140 | Have you been to the Creators Chamber?
525 | 1149 | 1148 | Have you been back to the Embarkation Lobby?
526 | 1145 | 1144 | Have you been using the elevators?
527 | 1153 | 1152 | Have you had a proper talk with Marsinta?
528 | 1161 | 1160 | Have you been to the Music Room yet?
529 | 1165 | 1164 | Have you had a look at the Promenade Deck yet?
530 | 1169 | 1168 | Have you had a look at the Sculpture Chamber?
531 | 1173 | 1172 | Did you visit the SGT Lounge?
532 | 1177 | 1176 | Did you have a proper look at the SGT Restaurant?
533 | 1181 | 1180 | Have you seen Titania's Room?
534 | 1205 | 1204 | the First Class Restaurant?
535 | 1209 | 1208 | the First Class Staterooms?
536 | 1213 | 1212 | the Second Class Staterooms?
537 | 1217 | 1216 | the Arboretum?
538 | 1221 | 1220 | the Bilge Room?
539 | 1225 | 1224 | the Bottom of the Well?
540 | 1245 | 1244 | the Grand Axial Canal?
541 | 1229 | 1228 | the Creators Chamber?
542 | 1237 | 1236 | the Embarkation Lobby?
543 | 1233 | 1232 | the elevators - have you tried all the floors yet?
544 | 1241 | 1240 | Marsinta - have you had a chat with her yet?
545 | 1249 | 1248 | the Music Room?
546 | 1253 | 1252 | the Promenade Deck?
547 | 1257 | 1256 | the Sculpture Chamber?
548 | 1261 | 1260 | the SGT Lounge?
549 | 1265 | 1264 | the SGT Restaurant?
550 | 1269 | 1268 | Titania's Room?
551 | 1033 | 1032 | Well, it just might be worth having a wee look around the First Class Restaurant.
552 | 1037 | 1036 | Maybe you should check out some of the First Class Staterooms.
553 | 1041 | 1040 | Maybe you ought to have another look round your Second Class Stateroom.
554 | 1045 | 1044 | Why don't you see what's happening in the Arboretum?
555 | 1049 | 1048 | Maybe you should go see the Bilge Room?
556 | 1053 | 1052 | Maybe you should have another look in the Bilge Room?
557 | 1057 | 1056 | You've not been down to the Bottom of the Well yet have you? So now's a good time to do it.
558 | 1115 | 1114 | Of course, it's the Bridge you really need to reach, but you'll have to fix Titania first to get access.
559 | 1075 | 1074 | Have you been up the Grand Axial Canal? There's a lot to see up there all right.
560 | 1061 | 1060 | Have you had a good look in the Creators Chamber? I hear there's some odd stuff in there all right.
561 | 1065 | 1064 | You should use the elevator a bit more - have a proper look round the ship.
562 | 1071 | 1070 | Why not visit the Embarkation Lobby and have a wee chat with Marsinta?
563 | 1079 | 1078 | Why not go up to the Music Room? Damn sight better music than the stuff they pipe in here.
564 | 1273 | 1272 | Well perhaps you should give it a go.
565 | 1275 | 1274 | Maybe you ought to check it out then.
566 | 1277 | 1276 | Given the mess I'm in here I'd be grateful if you checked it out.
567 | 1279 | 1278 | Would you mind awfully having a wee look - it'd make a BarBot eternally happy.
568 | 1083 | 1082 | Fentible was telling me there's a parrot on board. Maybe you should go check it out.
569 | 1189 | 1188 | Ah well. What about.
570 | 1193 | 1192 | I see. Well what about.
571 | 1197 | 1196 | Right. How about.
572 | 1201 | 1200 | Mmm. What about.
573 | 1087 | 1086 | You've not been up to the Promenade Deck yet. You know you really should pay it a visit.
574 | 1091 | 1090 | I think a visit to the Sculpture Chamber is long overdue - but then, what do I know?
575 | 1095 | 1094 | If you didn't visit the SGT Lounge, well maybe you should go back and have another look.
576 | 1099 | 1098 | You know, I'm thinking the SGT Restaurant might hold a clue.
577 | 1103 | 1102 | Now I reckon you've missed out one of the highlights of the ship - Titania's Room.
578 | 1107 | 1106 | I know you've already been to Titania's Room but it's still worth another visit.
579 | 1111 | 1110 | Head up to the Top of the Well - get things in perspective.
580 | 1329 | 1328 | It takes you up and it takes you along.
581 | 1331 | 1330 | It has little buttons you press that take you where you want to go.
582 | 2135 | 2134 | Actors eh. What would the theatre be without them? Empty I suppose.
583 | 2137 | 2136 | Actresses. What would we do without them. What would actors do without them.
584 | 2139 | 2138 | Advertising. Oh it's a powerful tool.
585 | 2141 | 2140 | Artists eh? Paint all over the place. Inspiration. Heavy drinking. Suicide. It's no life for a grown man.
586 | 2143 | 2142 | Art. I'll tell you one thing: I know what I like and I like what I know.
587 | 2145 | 2144 | Writers eh? Solitary life. Divorces, drink, drugs, failure, highs, lows, pencil sharpeners. Ah, it's a dog's life.
588 | 2259 | 2258 | If you fix this damn loop you'd find the service a whole lot better I can tell you.
589 | 2255 | 2254 | If all the barmen in all the galaxy were gathered together... there'd be a lot of people waiting for their drinks I can tell you.
590 | 2147 | 2146 | You pay for the name don't you. Still, you can't argue with that.
591 | 2149 | 2148 | I'm not a great cheese fan. Gets stuck in the pumps.
592 | 2151 | 2150 | Ah comedians. Tears behind the clown's face, broken marriages, suicide, drink, drugs, unwelcome newspaper articles. Still if they can't take a joke they shouldn't join, that's what I say.
593 | 2153 | 2152 | Food. What would we do without it eh? Course, I don't eat it. I'm a robot.
594 | 2155 | 2154 | Cop shows. Full of mistakes: never get the Bars right.
595 | 2157 | 2156 | Crime? I blame the criminals.
596 | 2123 | 2122 | If you ask me that parrot's not all it seems - got squinty eyes it has.
597 | 2159 | 2158 | Directors eh? Huh. Big cars, casting couches, drugs, drink, suicide, broken marriages, ulcers, heart attacks. Beats working behind a bar any day.
598 | 2129 | 2128 | Fancy Feet Fortillian they used to call me - soon as we get this cocktail on the road I'll show you.
599 | 2161 | 2160 | Drugs. Take em or leave em that's what I say.
600 | 2163 | 2162 | Interesting planet you have there.
601 | 2165 | 2164 | Feelings - who needs them? People, I suppose.
602 | 2167 | 2166 | Celebrities eh? Can't live at the top for ever. Nose jobs, blackmail, photos, affairs, drugs, drink, suicide, broken marriages. Still, I hear the pay's good.
603 | 2169 | 2168 | What do you think of this little number? Pretty cool eh?
604 | 2171 | 2170 | Yes well, maybe that's enough about me for now.
605 | 2173 | 2172 | You know- an animal's not an animal unless you can make a decent cocktail twirler out of it.
606 | 2175 | 2174 | You ought to get out more. Sitting in a darkened room watching flickering lights is bad for you. Unless it's a bar of course.
607 | 2177 | 2176 | Well you know what they say: Bars and fish don't mix.
608 | 2179 | 2178 | If you like flowers you ought to head up to the Arboretum.
609 | 2181 | 2180 | You know the one thing I really miss being a Bot? Bacon sandwiches.
610 | 2183 | 2182 | I had a hobby once. I used to make tiny Bots out of matchsticks and put them in bottles. Pointless really, looking back on it.
611 | 2185 | 2184 | Sort this Titanic Titillator out and you'll be a hero to me, I can tell you.
612 | 2261 | 2260 | Personally I don't find domestic appliances that exciting.
613 | 2187 | 2186 | Know where my heart is? A little place called Blargh. On my mother's mantelpiece. In a bottle.
614 | 2189 | 2188 | TV stars eh? Illusory fame, depression, empty lives, ill-advised marriages, three in a bed romps, alcoholism, tabloid exposes. Somebody has to do it I suppose.
615 | 2191 | 2190 | Royalty eh? Just like you and me. Only they're absurdly wealthy and I'm not.
616 | 2193 | 2192 | I'll get you one just as soon as you've fixed this loop.
617 | 2195 | 2194 | Books who needs them? Bookshops I suppose.
618 | 2197 | 2196 | Don't get time for magazines in this job. Especially when you're stuck in a loop like this.
619 | 2127 | 2126 | I don't care who makes the stuff - just as long as it's got rhythm.
620 | 2125 | 2124 | Music. Where would we be without it? Actually we'd be a damned sight happier without the music in here, I can tell you. It's driving me nuts.
621 | 2199 | 2198 | I wonder if we could call in an air-strike - get rid of that damned parrot.
622 | 2201 | 2200 | I wonder if we could call in an air-strike - get rid of that damned parrot.
623 | 2203 | 2202 | You know you really ought to check out the guys in the music room - you'd love them.
624 | 2131 | 2130 | Very amusing, very nautical.
625 | 2205 | 2204 | One rule I have in my bar - no politics.
626 | 2207 | 2206 | No use talking fancy ideas to me - I'm just your average BarBot.
627 | 2209 | 2208 | Get me out of this cocktail loop and who knows - it could be your lucky day.
628 | 2211 | 2210 | If you ask me, space is over-rated. There's far more than we really need.
629 | 2213 | 2212 | Politicians - they get my vote every time.
630 | 2215 | 2214 | I could have been a rocket scientist you know. Only one thing stopped me - I haven't got a brain.
631 | 2115 | 2114 | Science. Oh it's a magical thing isn't it.
632 | 2217 | 2216 | Ah science. There's a big subject all right.
633 | 2117 | 2116 | Scientists. Now they're fellas with big brains all right.
634 | 2219 | 2218 | One good thing about being a Bot. You miss out on all the messy stuff.
635 | 2221 | 2220 | Science fiction. Don't believe in it myself.
636 | 2111 | 2110 | Slow is as slow does, and don't you forget it.
637 | 2223 | 2222 | Nothing wrong with a good soap - just as long as it doesn't eat into your drinking time.
638 | 2225 | 2224 | You go ahead and sing if it makes you happy.
639 | 2227 | 2226 | You want to talk sport - let's talk Nib.
640 | 2229 | 2228 | Hey! Cut that out!
641 | 2231 | 2230 | Now now, no swearing in the bar please.
642 | 2233 | 2232 | If you have to swear could you go into the lobby to do it. thank you.
643 | 2235 | 2234 | House rules - no swearing in the public areas please.
644 | 2237 | 2236 | Swear one more time and I shall be forced to shut down until further notice.
645 | 2119 | 2118 | D'you know, that name rings a bell. Must have been someone I knew at cocktail college.
646 | 2239 | 2238 | Course there's not a team in the galaxy could hack it playing Nib.
647 | 2113 | 2112 | You just get it out of your system - you'll feel a lot better.
648 | 2257 | 2256 | Fine. Put me out of my misery.
649 | 2121 | 2120 | Shouldn't believe everything you read in books. I read that in a paper.
650 | 2133 | 2132 | Sorry, but the TLA server is down at the moment.
651 | 2241 | 2240 | Do you know what I think would make a great toy? A little tiny BarBot on wheels. You could have it at home running round getting your drinks.
652 | 2243 | 2242 | I didn't know car planets still existed.
653 | 2245 | 2244 | You still have planes? How quaint.
654 | 2247 | 2246 | Don't get time to watch TV.
655 | 2249 | 2248 | By the way, if you get access to any weapons do feel free to have a go at the parrot.
656 | 2253 | 2252 | Course if you want to try your hand at weather forecasting - just pop up to the Arboretum.
657 | 2251 | 2250 | Talking of computers - you realize we're relying on you to put Titania back together again.
658 | 1311 | 1310 | This is the Bar.
659 | 1313 | 1312 | I'm Fortillian. I'm the BarBot.
660 | 1319 | 1318 | That's the Bell you use to get service.
661 | 1297 | 1296 | It's a Glass.
662 | 1317 | 1316 | Well, I do believe that's a Glass.
663 | 1315 | 1314 | That's the cocktail menu monitor.
664 | 1325 | 1324 | That's the Pellerator.
665 | 1327 | 1326 | It's a cross between an elevator and a travelator.
666 | 1309 | 1308 | It's a trans-galactic liner.
667 | 1305 | 1304 | We're on the Starship Titanic.
668 | 1307 | 1306 | It's called the Starship Titanic.
669 | 1299 | 1298 | Oh, you mean the bright shiny blue thing?
670 | 1301 | 1300 | That looks like Titania's Vision Center.
671 | 1303 | 1302 | It's the Vision Center.
672 | 1321 | 1320 | The bar's empty because - there's nobody in it.
673 | 1323 | 1322 | There's nobody in it - because there are no passengers. Your good self excepted of course.
674 | 3683 | 3682 | I seem to remember someone talking about the Creators Chamber in respect of passwords.
675 | 3855 | 3854 | Mmm. Perturbing.
676 | 2271 | 2270 | Anything to do with your PET - ask the DoorBot.
677 | 2273 | 2272 | Like I said - PETs are more the DoorBot's line than mine.
678 | 2275 | 2274 | PETs? I stay clear of them - you ask the DoorBot.
679 | 2625 | 2624 | Change your PET to Designer Room Number mode, and then drag the code for the room you want.
680 | 2621 | 2620 | Easy. All the rooms have chevrons to identify them. Even your stateroom. So if you know the chevron for where you want to go you can use your PET to tell an elevator or Pellerator where to take you. You can also drag chevron codes from your PET to tell the Succ-U-Bus where to send something if you want.
681 | 2623 | 2622 | Put something in the tray, use your PET to give the Succ-U-Bus the Chevron code for the room you want to send it to, and off it goes. Whoever's at the other end then presses their receive button and out it pops - just like that.
682 | 2627 | 2626 | Change your PET to Personal Baggage mode, and then drag whatever it is you're after straight into it.
683 | 2633 | 2632 | Don't give up now - you're the only hope we've got.
684 | 2635 | 2634 | Just switch your PET to Remote Thingummy mode. Then choose the thing you want to control, and... control it.
685 | 2631 | 2630 | Change your PET to Real Life mode and I'm sure you'll see the option you're after.
686 | 1721 | 1720 | It's the salt: it corrodes my fingers.
687 | 1719 | 1718 | Peanuts.
688 | 1761 | 1760 | Nib? You want to talk about Nib?
689 | 1763 | 1762 | How can I describe Nib. Greatest, most dangerous, awesome game ever invented.
690 | 2367 | 2366 | It's a bar game, very popular at Christmas. Quite messy.
691 | 3615 | 3614 | Advertising - just a nice name for lying, eh? Like Super Galactic Traveler Class. Ha! That's a good one.
692 | 3769 | 3768 | Well now you don't see many of those round here. What was it again?
693 | 3771 | 3770 | I thought that's what you said. Never heard of it.
694 | 1937 | 1936 | Did you find that chicken you were looking for earlier?
695 | 1955 | 1954 | You should be able to walk on the ice then.
696 | 1957 | 1956 | You know you're allowed to change the weather, don't you.
697 | 1959 | 1958 | Just fiddle with the knobs on the weather controls in the Arboretum.
698 | 1961 | 1960 | Did you sort the music out?
699 | 1963 | 1962 | Did you figure out what happened in the First Class Restaurant?
700 | 1965 | 1964 | Did you have any joy in the Bilge Room?
701 | 1967 | 1966 | Did you sort out the fuses in Titania's Room?
702 | 1939 | 1938 | Did you find the napkin you were looking for?
703 | 1969 | 1968 | Have you been sneezing?
704 | 1987 | 1986 | Have you found Titania's Vision Center yet?
705 | 1989 | 1988 | Have you found Titania's Olfactory Center yet?
706 | 1991 | 1990 | Have you found Titania's Speech Center yet?
707 | 1993 | 1992 | Are you still looking for a long stick?
708 | 1995 | 1994 | Is it true you've found a body?
709 | 1997 | 1996 | Who is it - do you know?
710 | 1999 | 1998 | The Accountant. Couldn't have happened to a nicer fella.
711 | 2001 | 2000 | The Project Manager. Did he fall in a Succ-U-Bus do you think?
712 | 2003 | 2002 | Did you search the body?
713 | 2005 | 2004 | Well don't you think you ought to?
714 | 2007 | 2006 | What did you find?
715 | 2009 | 2008 | Was there anything written on them?
716 | 1971 | 1970 | Krage was telling me he's been hearing sneezing all day.
717 | 2011 | 2010 | Far as I know all the fuse boxes are up in Titania's Room - check it out.
718 | 1973 | 1972 | Have you worked out how to change the Bot settings?
719 | 1975 | 1974 | You need some kind of a pipe or a hose.
720 | 1977 | 1976 | Have you found Titania's eyes yet?
721 | 1979 | 1978 | Have you found Titania's nose yet?
722 | 1981 | 1980 | Have you found Titania's ears yet?
723 | 1983 | 1982 | Have you found Titania's mouth yet?
724 | 1985 | 1984 | Have you found Titania's Auditory Center yet?
725 | 1941 | 1940 | Did you get that awful chicken machine to work?
726 | 2013 | 2012 | Any luck with the lemon?
727 | 2031 | 2030 | I hear you've been taking a look at the ship's mail system. Did you find anything useful?
728 | 2037 | 2036 | Ah, I see from your PET that you've found what you were looking for.
729 | 2015 | 2014 | Any joy with the starling puree?
730 | 2017 | 2016 | Did you find a TV set?
731 | 2019 | 2018 | What exactly is it you're looking for now?
732 | 2021 | 2020 | Did you have any luck with the bomb?
733 | 2023 | 2022 | Did you find that hammer you were looking for?
734 | 2025 | 2024 | Did you sort things out with the Maitre d'Bot?
735 | 2027 | 2026 | Have you met the Maitre d'Bot yet?
736 | 2029 | 2028 | Have you got yourself a First Class upgrade yet?
737 | 1943 | 1942 | Did you work out how to get that damned parrot out of the way?
738 | 1945 | 1944 | Did you find the room with the moth in it?
739 | 1947 | 1946 | Did you get your room changed?
740 | 1949 | 1948 | What's the weather like in the Arboretum?
741 | 1951 | 1950 | Is it winter or summer?
742 | 1953 | 1952 | You should be able to see what's in the trees then.
743 | 2081 | 2080 | Right away.
744 | 3757 | 3756 | When the mood's right.
745 | 3659 | 3658 | You can say that again.
746 | 1699 | 1698 | No. Have you?
747 | 1703 | 1702 | Join the club then.
748 | 1701 | 1700 | Was it good?
749 | 1693 | 1692 | Me neither.
750 | 1705 | 1704 | Now how could I do that? I'm stuck here aren't I...
751 | 3657 | 3656 | SGT stands for Super-Galactic Traveler class.
752 | 1681 | 1680 | No. Have you?
753 | 1685 | 1684 | Well that makes two of us.
754 | 1683 | 1682 | Oh, well that's nice for you.
755 | 3603 | 3602 | Achoo!
756 | 3605 | 3604 | Achoo!
757 | 3607 | 3606 | Achoo!
758 | 3609 | 3608 | Achoo!
759 | 3635 | 3634 | Call it what you like, someone's got to do it - well, it's a job that's got to be done isn't it? I'm allowed to have a hobby aren't I?
760 | 3749 | 3748 | Sometimes.
761 | 1861 | 1860 | I'm truly sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?
762 | 1863 | 1862 | Mmm. Actually on second thoughts there's nothing I can do anyway - I'm stuck in a loop here and have been for some time.
763 | 3625 | 3624 | So they say.
764 | 3629 | 3628 | So they tell me.
765 | 3623 | 3622 | So you say.
766 | 3627 | 3626 | So you tell me.
767 | 3847 | 3846 | Spot on.
768 | 1731 | 1730 | Have you tried changing his setting?
769 | 3631 | 3630 | I'm afraid I'm stuck in a loop here. You know how it is when you're a robot. Well, maybe you don't, but that's what it's like anyway.
770 | 2629 | 2628 | No can do I'm afraid. You can summon the BellBot and the DoorBot cos they're all over the ship. Me - I'm stuck here.
771 | 1933 | 1932 | Just as soon as you've got me out of this wretched loop.
772 | 1905 | 1904 | For one thing you don't have any bags and for another - that's really the BellBot's job not mine.
773 | 1689 | 1688 | No - even if I had I wouldn't remember.
774 | 2101 | 2100 | Thank you.
775 | 3619 | 3618 | That's as maybe.
776 | 3617 | 3616 | No, that would be telling, wouldn't it?
777 | 2097 | 2096 | This is the bar.
778 | 1697 | 1696 | Being a BarBot you don't get much time for thinking.
779 | 2537 | 2536 | Time you got a move on.
780 | 2555 | 2554 | Whenever you like.
781 | 2539 | 2538 | Never.
782 | 2541 | 2540 | Immediately.
783 | 2543 | 2542 | Right away.
784 | 2545 | 2544 | Soon.
785 | 2547 | 2546 | Later.
786 | 2549 | 2548 | Earlier.
787 | 2551 | 2550 | Just missed it.
788 | 2553 | 2552 | If you hurry you might just make it.
789 | 2557 | 2556 | Have you tried the Bar?
790 | 2559 | 2558 | Have you tried the Restaurant?
791 | 2991 | 2990 | Ahhh.
792 | 2807 | 2806 | Krage's a waste of memory.
793 | 2813 | 2812 | Marsinta's a right snob. Never been in the bar yet.
794 | 2809 | 2808 | Fentible should be on the scrap heap.
795 | 2811 | 2810 | Nobby's a right pain. Should have been recycled.
796 | 2817 | 2816 | Maitre d'Bot's a right little snob.
797 | 2815 | 2814 | RowBot drives me mad even at this distance.
798 | 2995 | 2994 | Ah ha.
799 | 3009 | 3008 | Sheee... Huh huh huh.
800 | 3023 | 3022 | Hey Krage! You're barred. Get out!
801 | 3025 | 3024 | Hey Fentible! No DoorBots - OK?
802 | 3027 | 3026 | Bloody parrot!
803 | 3029 | 3028 | Off with you, you pesky little creature!
804 | 3031 | 3030 | Damn parrots flying all over the shop! Huh!
805 | 3033 | 3032 | Ship's full of parrots! They'd better not belong to you.
806 | 2913 | 2912 | What do I care? Ask a BellBot or a DoorBot.
807 | 3357 | 3356 | Don't you just hate it when robots don't work?
808 | 3359 | 3358 | I'm beginning to annoy you aren't I? I do hope I am.
809 | 3361 | 3360 | Isn't it annoying when a robot doesn't understand you?
810 | 3325 | 3324 | Look even if I had a blender I wouldn't tell you. So shut up about blenders, OK?
811 | 3035 | 3034 | Have you managed to disarm that bomb yet?
812 | 3037 | 3036 | Are you getting anywhere with that bomb or are you just going to pretend it doesn't exist?
813 | 3039 | 3038 | If you don't defuse that bomb soon you're going to blow us all up.
814 | 3041 | 3040 | Can I remind you about the bomb - or are you just too stupid to care?
815 | 3043 | 3042 | Krage says the bomb's still counting down. But what do you care?
816 | 3015 | 3014 | Nothing worth bothering your little mind with.
817 | 3017 | 3016 | That's not important.
818 | 3019 | 3018 | You don't need to bother with that.
819 | 3021 | 3020 | Nothing you need to worry about.
820 | 3343 | 3342 | Sorry, can't help.
821 | 997 | 996 | Why bring that up now? Because you're an idiot I suppose.
822 | 999 | 998 | What is the point of bringing that up now? You're useless - what are you?
823 | 1001 | 1000 | You said it.
824 | 1003 | 1002 | Well aren't we a bit of a smartass today.
825 | 1005 | 1004 | You are beginning to bore me my friend. Get off your backside and do something useful.
826 | 1007 | 1006 | While you're here gassing like a drunken donkey there's a bomb needs dealing with. Or did you forget it already?
827 | 1009 | 1008 | Well do something about it.
828 | 1011 | 1010 | Do you WANT to blow us up?
829 | 1015 | 1014 | Well you're going the wrong way about it.
830 | 1013 | 1012 | Well don't expect any help from me.
831 | 2887 | 2886 | Damn these Cellpoint settings - will they not stay still for a moment?
832 | 2889 | 2888 | Dammit! My settings have changed again.
833 | 2891 | 2890 | Aaghh! There go me Cellpoint settings.
834 | 3273 | 3272 | Correct.
835 | 3453 | 3452 | Bantoburn.
836 | 3455 | 3454 | O'Perfluous.
837 | 3011 | 3010 | Ah... Dear oh dear.
838 | 2685 | 2684 | You could try saying something intelligent or.
839 | 2689 | 2688 | Go figure it out for yourself - I'm not going to help you.
840 | 2687 | 2686 | Change her settings.
841 | 2793 | 2792 | You never cease to amaze me.
842 | 2795 | 2794 | What do you mean?
843 | 2797 | 2796 | You come out with the most staggering inanities.
844 | 2799 | 2798 | Hey fellas! It's the walking encyclopaedia again.
845 | 3691 | 3690 | If I wasn't stuck in this loop I'd come round that bar and stick this bell where the sun doesn't shine - OK?
846 | 3693 | 3692 | If you keep doing that you'll break it.
847 | 3695 | 3694 | Brilliant. You've broken it. Ruined it for everyone. You're an eejit aren't you. A right eejit.
848 | 3375 | 3374 | Earlier.
849 | 2775 | 2774 | Not telling.
850 | 2777 | 2776 | I don't like you.
851 | 2779 | 2778 | You keep asking the same dumb questions.
852 | 2763 | 2762 | What I buy or don't buy is my business.
853 | 2765 | 2764 | Oh yes. Drink everything, I do.
854 | 2767 | 2766 | Yes.
855 | 2769 | 2768 | Drunk's for failures.
856 | 2753 | 2752 | No. Reading gets in the way of drinking and being rude.
857 | 2821 | 2820 | No but I'm sure you're going to tell me you have.
858 | 2647 | 2646 | None of your business.
859 | 2791 | 2790 | No but with you in the Bar I'm tempted to start.
860 | 2783 | 2782 | I refuse to answer that question on the grounds that I might incriminate myself.
861 | 2785 | 2784 | Are you thick as well as ugly?
862 | 2789 | 2788 | You can only lie to yourself for so long.
863 | 2787 | 2786 | At least you're honest.
864 | 2781 | 2780 | If I had I wouldn't tell you.
865 | 2703 | 2702 | No.
866 | 2705 | 2704 | Why do you think?
867 | 2707 | 2706 | Maybe, maybe not.
868 | 2709 | 2708 | Me neither.
869 | 3237 | 3236 | What do you take me for - the maintenance engineer? Fix it.
870 | 3239 | 3238 | I don't know. Kick it. Change the fuse. You'll think of something.
871 | 2801 | 2800 | I don't give a fig.
872 | 2803 | 2802 | Who gives a hoot?
873 | 2805 | 2804 | You're not important.
874 | 3331 | 3330 | Of course it's highly unlikely you got the ingredients right.
875 | 3333 | 3332 | I'll just add a splash of Signurian Vodka.
876 | 3063 | 3062 | Find it yourself.
877 | 3013 | 3012 | Foof!
878 | 3257 | 3256 | To be honest - I'd rather see that full of starling puree.
879 | 3259 | 3258 | Because I need it for the Titanic Titillator.
880 | 3255 | 3254 | Here. Take this. Fill it full of starling puree. Bring it back. What could be easier.
881 | 3267 | 3266 | Astonishing. You've managed to do something right.
882 | 3251 | 3250 | What am I supposed to do with this you cretin?
883 | 3253 | 3252 | Dear oh dear oh dear. Lemons. TV's. Puree. Got it?
884 | 3261 | 3260 | What's this muck you've brought me?
885 | 3265 | 3264 | Mmm. Could be. Could be starling puree though. Worth a try.
886 | 3263 | 3262 | Some hope. Still, it's worth a try.
887 | 3269 | 3268 | Crushed television. I didn't think you had the brains to get it.
888 | 3335 | 3334 | Take it. Now bugger off.
889 | 2773 | 2772 | Avoiding you.
890 | 2823 | 2822 | Well wonders will never cease. What do you want?
891 | 2825 | 2824 | How you got an upgrade beats me. Are you going to help me now?
892 | 2827 | 2826 | Have you got anything for me?
893 | 2829 | 2828 | I know it's unlikely, but have you had any luck with the missing elements for the Titillator?
894 | 2831 | 2830 | Terrific. I'm going to be mixing this drink well into eternity.
895 | 2833 | 2832 | Brilliant. If the bomb doesn't get me the boredom will.
896 | 2835 | 2834 | I'll believe it when I see it. Show me what you've got.
897 | 3003 | 3002 | Ha!
898 | 3065 | 3064 | Hah!
899 | 3589 | 3588 | Happy hour finished the moment I saw your face you miserable little toerag.
900 | 3329 | 3328 | Fortunately your opinion counts for nothing in here sunshine.
901 | 2673 | 2672 | No. Do you?
902 | 2677 | 2676 | You'll have no-one to blame the droppings on then.
903 | 2675 | 2674 | I'm sure you're made for each other.
904 | 2655 | 2654 | Gossip's more your line.
905 | 2637 | 2636 | Maybe. What's it to you?
906 | 2759 | 2758 | Why should I? You're the pits.
907 | 2761 | 2760 | I'll only help you when my Cellpoint setting is changed. It's not my fault. Dipstick.
908 | 1119 | 1118 | Have you been up to the First Class Restaurant?
909 | 1123 | 1122 | Have you looked around the First Class Staterooms?
910 | 1127 | 1126 | Have you had a proper look round your Second Class Stateroom?
911 | 1131 | 1130 | Have you been to the Arboretum yet?
912 | 1135 | 1134 | Have you visited the Bilge Room yet?
913 | 1139 | 1138 | Have you been down to the Bottom of the Well yet?
914 | 1159 | 1158 | Have you been up the Grand Axial Canal?
915 | 1143 | 1142 | Have you been to the Creators Chamber?
916 | 1151 | 1150 | Have you been back to the Embarkation Lobby?
917 | 1147 | 1146 | Have you been using the elevators?
918 | 1155 | 1154 | Have you bored the ass off Marsinta yet?
919 | 1163 | 1162 | Have you been up to the Music Room yet?
920 | 1167 | 1166 | Have you had a look at the Promenade Deck yet?
921 | 1171 | 1170 | Have you had a look at the Sculpture Chamber?
922 | 1175 | 1174 | Did you visit the SGT Lounge?
923 | 1179 | 1178 | Did you have a proper look at the SGT Restaurant?
924 | 1183 | 1182 | Have you seen Titania's Room?
925 | 1207 | 1206 | the First Class Restaurant?
926 | 1211 | 1210 | the First Class Staterooms?
927 | 1215 | 1214 | the Second Class Staterooms?
928 | 1219 | 1218 | the Arboretum?
929 | 1223 | 1222 | the Bilge Room?
930 | 1227 | 1226 | the Bottom of the Well?
931 | 1247 | 1246 | the Grand Axial Canal?
932 | 1231 | 1230 | the Creators Chamber?
933 | 1239 | 1238 | the Embarkation Lobby?
934 | 1235 | 1234 | the elevators - have you tried all the floors yet?
935 | 1243 | 1242 | Marsinta - have you pestered her yet?
936 | 1251 | 1250 | the Music Room?
937 | 1255 | 1254 | the Promenade Deck?
938 | 1259 | 1258 | the Sculpture Chamber?
939 | 1263 | 1262 | the SGT Lounge?
940 | 1267 | 1266 | the SGT Restaurant?
941 | 1271 | 1270 | Titania's Room?
942 | 1035 | 1034 | I don't believe the First Class Restaurant has had the pleasure yet of seeing your fat spotty face.
943 | 1039 | 1038 | Since you conned your way into First Class maybe you should check out the Staterooms.
944 | 1043 | 1042 | You're a second class person so why not check out your Second Class Stateroom.
945 | 1047 | 1046 | Take a trip to the Arboretum. You're as thick as two short planks - you'd like it there.
946 | 1051 | 1050 | Take a trip to the Bilge Room. You'd like it there - you certainly talk enough of it.
947 | 1055 | 1054 | Go back to the Bilge Room - it's your kind of place.
948 | 1059 | 1058 | Check out the Bottom of the Well. You'd like it there - you can't get much lower.
949 | 1077 | 1076 | Go up to the Grand Axial Canal. With a bit of luck you'll fall in.
950 | 1063 | 1062 | Take a look at the Creators Chamber. It's a weird place. You'd be at home there all right.
951 | 1067 | 1066 | Take a ride in the elevator. See how the other half live.
952 | 1073 | 1072 | Why don't you go down to the Embarkation Lobby and bore Marsinta for a change?
953 | 1081 | 1080 | Go and bore the guys in the Music Room. Why should it just be me that has to suffer?
954 | 1281 | 1280 | Well why don't you get off your fat ass and go there?
955 | 1283 | 1282 | Well go on then you daft beggar - go and have a look.
956 | 1285 | 1284 | Well what are you waiting for?
957 | 1287 | 1286 | Terrific. I'll go and polish me glass then.
958 | 1289 | 1288 | Do you not think now's a good time to do it?
959 | 1293 | 1292 | Fine. Sit and stew. What do I care.
960 | 1291 | 1290 | Well what are you waiting for. Bog off.
961 | 1295 | 1294 | Look. It's your job to get the ship going, not hang around in bars. I can do that on my own thank you very much.
962 | 1085 | 1084 | Fentible was telling me there's a parrot on board. Check it out - you and a parrot should have lots in common.
963 | 1069 | 1068 | Take a ride in the Pellerator. All you have to do is press a button - you should be able to manage that.
964 | 1191 | 1190 | I'm only asking. How about.
965 | 1195 | 1194 | Proper little boy scout aren't we. What about.
966 | 1199 | 1198 | Pardon me for taking an interest. What about.
967 | 1203 | 1202 | Been sticking your nose in everywhere I see. How about.
968 | 1089 | 1088 | Oh, you've not been up to the Promenade Deck yet. Who knows, you might slip and fall into the fan.
969 | 1093 | 1092 | You ought to visit the Sculpture Chamber - not that I expect you to understand art of course.
970 | 1097 | 1096 | Why not go back to the SGT Lounge. I'm sure you'll feel more at ease in third class.
971 | 1101 | 1100 | Well, I'm not sure you checked out the SGT Restaurant properly. You were probably too busy guzzling food.
972 | 1105 | 1104 | You ought to go to Titania's Room. It's way too classy for you, I know, but you still ought to go.
973 | 1109 | 1108 | Go back to Titania's Room. You were probably too overwhelmed to take it all in the first time.
974 | 1113 | 1112 | Head up to the Top of the Well - quite a treat for a primitive life form.
975 | 1429 | 1428 | Well you came here in it - can't you work it out for yourself.
976 | 1431 | 1430 | It takes you up and it takes you along.
977 | 1433 | 1432 | It has little buttons you press that take you where you want to go.
978 | 2837 | 2836 | Lousy, as usual. How are you?
979 | 2845 | 2844 | Let's change the subject shall we? Where are you going to get my crushed TV set?
980 | 2847 | 2846 | Let's change the subject shall we? Where are you going to get my lemons?
981 | 2849 | 2848 | Let's change the subject shall we? Where are you going to get my starling puree?
982 | 2841 | 2840 | Good, I'm glad to hear you're suffering. Course we'd all feel better if you got this cocktail fixed.
983 | 2843 | 2842 | Yes, it still cheers me to think of that.
984 | 2839 | 2838 | I'm sorry to hear that.
985 | 3457 | 3456 | Don't ask me. Even if I knew, I don't feel like telling you.
986 | 2907 | 2906 | What's it to you?
987 | 3001 | 3000 | Huh.
988 | 3379 | 3378 | If you hurry you might just make it - unfortunately.
989 | 3353 | 3352 | No I'm a hamster. Course I'm a robot you eejit.
990 | 3367 | 3366 | Immediately.
991 | 1333 | 1332 | Birdbrain.
992 | 1351 | 1350 | Toolhead.

1011 | 1387 | 1386 | Fishface.
1012 | 1389 | 1388 | You great simp.
1013 | 1337 | 1336 | Lardface.
1014 | 1391 | 1390 | You big bottom grub.

1018 | 1339 | 1338 | You great dunderhead.
1019 | 1341 | 1340 | You fat mutt.
1020 | 1343 | 1342 | You big grubber.
1021 | 1345 | 1344 | Hog face.
1022 | 1347 | 1346 | Mule head.
1023 | 1349 | 1348 | Donkey-brain.
1024 | 1435 | 1434 | Hey fat face, I was talking!
1025 | 1437 | 1436 | Just butt in why don't you - what do I care?
1026 | 1439 | 1438 | Oh fine. Don't mind me - you just interrupt whenever your glands tell you to.
1027 | 1441 | 1440 | Hey dog-brain - do you have to keep interrupting?
1028 | 2993 | 2992 | I see.
1029 | 2997 | 2996 | Uh huh... I see...
1030 | 3059 | 3058 | It's over there.
1031 | 3057 | 3056 | It's right behind you.
1032 | 3055 | 3054 | It's right here.
1033 | 2871 | 2870 | Fascinating. Does someone pay you to do that?
1034 | 2873 | 2872 | What about holidays. Do they let you out?
1035 | 2875 | 2874 | Do you enjoy it?
1036 | 2877 | 2876 | That's nice. Actually I'm not at all interested in your pathetic life. I just wanted to dupe you into believing I was. Ha.
1037 | 3377 | 3376 | You just missed it. Ha.
1038 | 2741 | 2740 | No. Do you?
1039 | 2743 | 2742 | Let's keep it that way.
1040 | 2745 | 2744 | So why bother me?
1041 | 2747 | 2746 | Anyone ever tell you how boring you are?
1042 | 2751 | 2750 | You get the friends you deserve I guess.
1043 | 2749 | 2748 | Least you've got honest friends.
1044 | 2739 | 2738 | Only member I know is you.
1045 | 3373 | 3372 | Later.
1046 | 3387 | 3386 | Ha ha ha!
1047 | 3389 | 3388 | Ha ha ha!
1048 | 3391 | 3390 | Ha ha ha!
1049 | 3393 | 3392 | Ha ha ha!
1050 | 3551 | 3550 | Right. Now get me parrot giblets and be quick about it.
1051 | 3569 | 3568 | I don't want to listen to your excuses. Get me what I want, get it right and get it now.
1052 | 3571 | 3570 | Shut up with your pathetic excuses. I'm not interested.
1053 | 3573 | 3572 | Fill the glass with feathers.
1054 | 3575 | 3574 | Well go and get some. Now.
1055 | 3577 | 3576 | Go and get a key. I want to unlock that menu monitor.
1056 | 3553 | 3552 | I need feathers you great lummock. Get me feathers.
1057 | 3555 | 3554 | A big stick that's what we need. Go and find one.
1058 | 3557 | 3556 | I need chicken in this cocktail. Surely you've seen chicken somewhere, the ship's full of them.
1059 | 3559 | 3558 | Haven't you seen mustard anywhere? This cocktail needs mustard and it needs it fast.
1060 | 3561 | 3560 | I don't want this. It's crap. Take it back.
1061 | 3563 | 3562 | I said crushed parrot feathers, not TV's. You're just an excuse for a dog's rear end, that's what you are.
1062 | 3565 | 3564 | Get me a crushed BellBot and get it quick. Don't hang about.
1063 | 3567 | 3566 | Get me a napkin to wipe this glass - it's filthy and it's your fault.
1064 | 2727 | 2726 | How many idiots like you will it take to solve the Titanic Titillator problem?
1065 | 2729 | 2728 | Sorry, I'm being sarcastic aren't I.
1066 | 2731 | 2730 | Well guess what. I don't care what you feel.
1067 | 2667 | 2666 | Is it good?
1068 | 2671 | 2670 | Then why bore me asking about it.
1069 | 2669 | 2668 | Then go and play it and don't bother me.
1070 | 3323 | 3322 | Bog off will you, I'm busy.
1071 | 3347 | 3346 | You're lower class without a doubt - whatever your PET tells you.
1072 | 2923 | 2922 | Maitre D'Bot doesn't move from the 1st Class Restaurant.
1073 | 2733 | 2732 | No, are you?
1074 | 2737 | 2736 | Jeez you do ask some dumbass questions.
1075 | 2735 | 2734 | Figures.
1076 | 3005 | 3004 | Mmmmm...
1077 | 2879 | 2878 | What an odd name. Did you make it up yourself?
1078 | 2883 | 2882 | Well it suits you.
1079 | 2881 | 2880 | I thought so - it's idiotic enough.
1080 | 3067 | 3066 | You've been taught some manners then.
1081 | 3069 | 3068 | Trying to suck up to me now are we.
1082 | 3071 | 3070 | Crawling's not going to help.
1083 | 3047 | 3046 | Not if I can help it.
1084 | 3049 | 3048 | Not in a quonth of Flatterdays.
1085 | 3051 | 3050 | Negative.
1086 | 3365 | 3364 | Never.
1087 | 2859 | 2858 | You sniveling, ingratiating toad-like little slime-ball. What can I get you?
1088 | 2861 | 2860 | I was kidding. I can't get you anything. I'm stuck in a loop.
1089 | 2863 | 2862 | The pleasure's all yours. Are you having a lovely time?
1090 | 2867 | 2866 | I'm pleased to hear that. I hate suffering alone.
1091 | 2865 | 2864 | Shame. As for me well I'm still in a mess - but what do you care.
1092 | 3045 | 3044 | Look. I'm a BarBot, not some kind of servant.
1093 | 3351 | 3350 | This isn't a game.
1094 | 3345 | 3344 | None of your damned business.
1095 | 3349 | 3348 | I'm going nowhere.
1096 | 3341 | 3340 | Course I do.
1097 | 2999 | 2998 | Oh...
1098 | 2683 | 2682 | Just you and the parrot.
1099 | 3327 | 3326 | Down there at the end of the bar are you BLIND AS WELL AS STUPID?
1100 | 2719 | 2718 | No. Did you?
1101 | 2723 | 2722 | Well why do you want to know?
1102 | 2725 | 2724 | Mmm. Here's an idea - why not go bore someone else for a change?
1103 | 2721 | 2720 | How fascinating for you.
1104 | 3461 | 3460 | How should I know? I'm the friggin BarBot not the maintenance man.
1105 | 3459 | 3458 | Ask a Bot will you? I'm busy here.
1106 | 3463 | 3462 | Look I'm a top of the range BarBot - don't ask me all this crap.
1107 | 3469 | 3468 | No, you've completely lost me there.
1108 | 3465 | 3464 | You say - I'd like a drink please.
1109 | 3467 | 3466 | Now you're just talking gibberish...
1110 | 2681 | 2680 | You're a pain in the butt.
1111 | 2679 | 2678 | You.
1112 | 2711 | 2710 | Nib? You want to talk about Nib?
1113 | 2713 | 2712 | Well I've got to be in a good mood to talk about Nib.
1114 | 2715 | 2714 | Change my settings.
1115 | 2717 | 2716 | Normally I wouldn't tell you. But I like talking about Nib. Go to the Sculpture Chamber and pull the levers.
1116 | 3103 | 3102 | Actors eh? What are they? Just barmen without the cocktail skills.
1117 | 3105 | 3104 | Actresses. Ha! If you laid all the actresses I've had in my Bar end to end... then again, maybe not.
1118 | 3107 | 3106 | Advertising. Oh it's a powerful tool. Whereas you - you're just a tool.
1119 | 3109 | 3108 | While you're faffing about talking art you could be getting this cocktail sorted.
1120 | 3111 | 3110 | Right now I don't give a flying fig about art. I want my lemons. I want my TV sets. I want my puree. And I want them now.
1121 | 3113 | 3112 | You and writers have got one thing in common - you're a waste of a good life.
1122 | 3233 | 3232 | Sooner you help, sooner I can get back to work. Even to a moron like you that should be obvious.
1123 | 3229 | 3228 | Frankly I'm not interested in other bars. I just want this one fixed.
1124 | 3115 | 3114 | Any time I want to know about brand names on your pathetic planet I'll ask.
1125 | 3117 | 3116 | Only cheesy thing round here's your dumbass attempts to get the ship working again.
1126 | 3119 | 3118 | Right now I'm not interested in comedy. I'm interested in solutions.
1127 | 3121 | 3120 | Who can think of food at a time like this? I need help, not food.
1128 | 3123 | 3122 | A cop would be a damn sight more use than you - but where are they just when you need one?
1129 | 3125 | 3124 | Only crime's been committed round here is letting you on board the ship.
1130 | 3091 | 3090 | Only conspiracy I know is the one that put you in charge of sorting out this cocktail.
1131 | 3127 | 3126 | Why don't you get off your butt and do something instead of just hanging round my bar talking movies.
1132 | 3097 | 3096 | I don't want to dance! I want lemons! I want tv sets! I want puree! And I want it now!
1133 | 3129 | 3128 | Any drugs you know that will make you more intelligent - take them 'cos your performance so far is way below average.
1134 | 3131 | 3130 | I don't want geography, I want results - OK?
1135 | 3133 | 3132 | If we're going to talk feelings - how do you think I feel, stuck in this loop like a mouse in a wheel.
1136 | 3135 | 3134 | I'm more interested in getting this loop fixed than talking tittle tattle.
1137 | 3137 | 3136 | Right now I don't give a flying frog about fashion.
1138 | 3139 | 3138 | You know, a trained monkey - even a little dog - would have been more help than you.
1139 | 3141 | 3140 | Let's talk cocktails shall we, not movies.
1140 | 3143 | 3142 | Fish? I don't want to talk to you about fish. I want to talk Titanic Titillator.
1141 | 3145 | 3144 | I just want to say one thing to that. Lemons.
1142 | 3147 | 3146 | Drinks is more my specialty. Don't confuse the issue with food.
1143 | 3149 | 3148 | This is no time for chit chat about hobbies. There's a job to do.
1144 | 3151 | 3150 | When Fentible said he'd found someone who was going to help I imagined some kind of superhero. I didn't expect a bozo like you.
1145 | 3153 | 3152 | That was fiction. This is for real and you've got a job to do buttbrain.
1146 | 3235 | 3234 | Has it sunk this low? I'm talking domestic appliances to a jerk from another planet.
1147 | 3155 | 3154 | Nobody's going home till you've fixed the ship - so get on with it will you.
1148 | 3157 | 3156 | There's more to life than TV. Talking of TV's - WHERE'S MINE?
1149 | 3159 | 3158 | Instead of gossiping about royalty - aren't you forgetting there's a job to do?
1150 | 3161 | 3160 | I'd like to be able to fix some drinks. But until some dumbass gets me out of this loop I can't.
1151 | 3163 | 3162 | Who's got time to read? You don't - you've got a job to do.
1152 | 3165 | 3164 | Come on, think. You must have more interesting things to say than that.
1153 | 3095 | 3094 | Don't talk music to me - the stuff they play in here is driving me mad as it is.
1154 | 3093 | 3092 | Instead of all this blathering about musical instruments how about giving me a hand?
1155 | 3167 | 3166 | Maybe Fentible should have got someone on board with a bit of military training. Would have been more use than you.
1156 | 3169 | 3168 | Talking of musicians. Why don't you give me a break and go up to the music room?
1157 | 3099 | 3098 | Very funny. Very nautical.
1158 | 3171 | 3170 | Don't give me politics. I want action. Get off your butt and DO something.
1159 | 3173 | 3172 | Don't waste my time with theory. Get me solutions.
1160 | 3175 | 3174 | You have got to be kidding. I draw the line at ugly and you passed through there a long time ago.
1161 | 3177 | 3176 | You want to see space go on a tour. You're only on board cos there's a job to do.
1162 | 3179 | 3178 | What use would a politician be? We've got a REAL problem to solve here.
1163 | 3181 | 3180 | Forget the history of space. If you don't get off your butt we're going to be history IN space.
1164 | 3077 | 3076 | What use is science? We've had it for millions of years - and have they come up with a hangover cure? No.
1165 | 3183 | 3182 | The only science I care about is the science of making a Titanic Titillator. Get on with it.
1166 | 3079 | 3078 | Talking of scientists. You ever meet one who offers you a brain transplant, I'd take it if I were you.
1167 | 3185 | 3184 | You disgust me. If I didn't need your help I'd have had Fentible throw you out on your ass.
1168 | 3187 | 3186 | I'll pretend I didn't hear that. In fact I'll even pretend I didn't understand it. But you are one foul creature all right.
1169 | 3189 | 3188 | Science fiction. Mmm. Only an idiot like you would believe in it.
1170 | 3073 | 3072 | When are you going to get off your ass and fix my cocktail?
1171 | 3191 | 3190 | How you waste your time is of no interest to me. I just want this loop fixed.
1172 | 3193 | 3192 | Please, spare my ears. No singing.
1173 | 3195 | 3194 | That's not a sport. There's only one sport. Nib.
1174 | 3197 | 3196 | Hey! Cut that out you foul-mouthed piece of scum.
1175 | 3199 | 3198 | No swearing in the bar or I'll have you thrown out.
1176 | 3201 | 3200 | No swearing in the public areas please.
1177 | 3203 | 3202 | Hey scumbag. No swearing or else...
1178 | 3205 | 3204 | You'll find yourself down in the bilge room.
1179 | 3207 | 3206 | Right, I won't give you another warning about swearing.
1180 | 3209 | 3208 | Right. That's it. You're bilged.
1181 | 3211 | 3210 | Swear one more time and I shall be forced to shut down until further notice.
1182 | 3081 | 3080 | I knew a fella of that name at cocktail college. Nasty little tyke he was.
1183 | 3083 | 3082 | I used to know somebody of that name. Had a terrible body odor problem.
1184 | 3085 | 3084 | Mmm. Name rings a bell. Bit of a jerk if I remember rightly.
1185 | 3087 | 3086 | I know that name. Ah yes I remember - real fashion victim.
1186 | 3213 | 3212 | Whatever they play it's a wuss game compared to the real thing - Nib.
1187 | 3075 | 3074 | How's this for a threat? Finish the cocktail or I'll get the parrot in here.
1188 | 3231 | 3230 | Do what you like. I doubt you 'll be able to do anything till this loop's broken.
1189 | 3089 | 3088 | Only good book's a cocktail book.
1190 | 3101 | 3100 | Proper whizz with those TLA's aren't you? Shame you're not as bright when it comes to fixing cocktails.
1191 | 3215 | 3214 | My god it's come to this. I'm talking toys to a freak from a dirt planet.
1192 | 3217 | 3216 | Talking of transport why don't you get in that Pellerator and go and do something useful for a change.
1193 | 3219 | 3218 | Instead of jabbering on about planes - why not give me some help?
1194 | 3221 | 3220 | The only TV interests me is a crushed one.
1195 | 3223 | 3222 | What I'd give for a weapon I could use on you right now.
1196 | 3227 | 3226 | The ship's out of control in hyperspace and you want to talk about the weather. What a useless creature you are.
1197 | 3225 | 3224 | You understand computers? With your brain?
1198 | 3471 | 3470 | I don't know stuff like that. Ask the BellBot or the DoorBot.
1199 | 2929 | 2928 | Did you find the chicken?
1200 | 2945 | 2944 | Did you sort the music out?
1201 | 2947 | 2946 | Did you figure out what happened in the First Class Restaurant?
1202 | 2949 | 2948 | Did you find anything in the Bilge Room?
1203 | 2951 | 2950 | Did you sort out the fuses in Titania's Room?
1204 | 2931 | 2930 | Did you find the napkin?
1205 | 2953 | 2952 | Have you been sneezing?
1206 | 2969 | 2968 | Have you found Titania's Vision Center yet?
1207 | 2971 | 2970 | Have you found Titania's Olfactory Center yet?
1208 | 2973 | 2972 | Have you found Titania's Speech Center yet?
1209 | 2975 | 2974 | Are you still looking for a long stick?
1210 | 2977 | 2976 | Is it true you've found a body?
1211 | 2957 | 2956 | Somebody is. I heard it.
1212 | 2955 | 2954 | Well don't.
1213 | 2959 | 2958 | Have you found Titania's eyes yet?
1214 | 2961 | 2960 | Have you found Titania's nose yet?
1215 | 2963 | 2962 | Have you found Titania's ears yet?
1216 | 2965 | 2964 | Have you found Titania's mouth yet?
1217 | 2967 | 2966 | Have you found Titania's Auditory Center yet?
1218 | 2933 | 2932 | Did you get that damned chicken machine to work?
1219 | 2979 | 2978 | What about my lemon. Have you got it yet?
1220 | 2981 | 2980 | Where's my starling puree?
1221 | 2983 | 2982 | Did you find a TV set? Get a move on.
1222 | 2985 | 2984 | What exactly is it you're looking for now?
1223 | 2987 | 2986 | Have you got that bomb defused yet?
1224 | 2935 | 2934 | Did you find out how to get that damned parrot out of the way?
1225 | 2937 | 2936 | Did you find the room with the moth in it?
1226 | 2939 | 2938 | Did you get your room changed?
1227 | 2941 | 2940 | What's the weather like in the Arboretum?
1228 | 2943 | 2942 | Is it winter or summer?
1229 | 3369 | 3368 | Right away.
1230 | 2659 | 2658 | No. Have you?
1231 | 2663 | 2662 | Why ask me then?
1232 | 2661 | 2660 | I'm so happy for you.
1233 | 2653 | 2652 | Yea, well you're not very bright are you.
1234 | 2665 | 2664 | All I see is your fat face and that's a fact.
1235 | 2641 | 2640 | No. Have you?
1236 | 2645 | 2644 | Well maybe I will then.
1237 | 2643 | 2642 | Well I'm glad I didn't.
1238 | 3371 | 3370 | Soon as I'm ready.
1239 | 3355 | 3354 | So you should be.
1240 | 2695 | 2694 | Have you tried changing his setting?
1241 | 2693 | 2692 | If my Cellpoint was set at pleasant I'd tell you, but it isn't so I won't.
1242 | 2697 | 2696 | Work it out - I'm not your nanny.
1243 | 3053 | 3052 | I suppose so.
1244 | 2925 | 2924 | Find it yourself.
1245 | 2893 | 2892 | Don't talk to me like that. Who do you think I am?
1246 | 2895 | 2894 | Right. And don't you forget it.
1247 | 2897 | 2896 | Proper comedian aren't we.
1248 | 2649 | 2648 | That's my business - all right?
1249 | 3061 | 3060 | This is the Bar mutton brain.
1250 | 2657 | 2656 | I don't get much time to think with you jabbering on all day long.
1251 | 3007 | 3006 | Tschk!
1252 | 2771 | 2770 | No - I like tv even less than I like you.
1253 | 2851 | 2850 | You like weather?
1254 | 3403 | 3402 | I think you're confusing me with somebody who gives a fig.
1255 | 2857 | 2856 | Oh I see. That was your pathetic attempt at making conversation.
1256 | 2853 | 2852 | Well why not bog off to the Arboretum.
1257 | 2855 | 2854 | They've got plenty of weather there.
1258 | 1413 | 1412 | This is the Bar.
1259 | 1415 | 1414 | I'm Fortillian. I'm the BarBot.
1260 | 1419 | 1418 | That's the Bell you use to get service.
1261 | 1399 | 1398 | It's a Glass.
1262 | 1417 | 1416 | That's a Glass.
1263 | 3337 | 3336 | Do you know nothing? It's an elevator that goes sideways.
1264 | 1425 | 1424 | That's the Pellerator.
1265 | 1427 | 1426 | It's a cross between an elevator and a travelator.
1266 | 1411 | 1410 | It's a trans-galactic liner.
1267 | 1407 | 1406 | We're on the Starship Titanic.
1268 | 1409 | 1408 | It's called the Starship Titanic.
1269 | 3301 | 3300 | Got any other stupid questions?
1270 | 3303 | 3302 | Good. Shut up then.
1271 | 3305 | 3304 | Go on then. Let's get it over with.
1272 | 1401 | 1400 | You mean that bright shiny blue thing?
1273 | 1403 | 1402 | That's Titania's Vision Center.
1274 | 1405 | 1404 | It's the Vision Center.
1275 | 2909 | 2908 | Nothing.
1276 | 2927 | 2926 | Last time I looked - the bar.
1277 | 3271 | 3270 | It's a giant fractal image of my ass. What do you think it is?
1278 | 3339 | 3338 | It controls my moods. So you just stay away from it - all right?
1279 | 2869 | 2868 | Are you blind as well as stupid? I'm the BarBot. Is there a role low enough in life for you?
1280 | 2989 | 2988 | What are you going to do now then?
1281 | 2819 | 2818 | That's what I say when I look at you.
1282 | 3363 | 3362 | Time you did something useful.
1283 | 3381 | 3380 | Whenever you like - no one else cares.
1284 | 3383 | 3382 | Have you ever heard the word 'bar'?
1285 | 3385 | 3384 | Never wondered what the word restaurant meant?
1286 | 2919 | 2918 | DeskBot's in the Embarkation Lobby.
1287 | 3241 | 3240 | I don't know. In the fuse box?
1288 | 3245 | 3244 | How should I know? Somebody must have taken the fuses.
1289 | 3247 | 3246 | Bots aren't allowed in Titania's Room.
1290 | 3249 | 3248 | Leovinus, Brobostigon and Scraliontis.
1291 | 3243 | 3242 | Do I have to tell you everything? Look in Titania's Room.
1292 | 2917 | 2916 | LiftBot's in the elevators - of course I wouldn't expect you to work that out.
1293 | 2915 | 2914 | First engage your brain. Then use your PET.
1294 | 2911 | 2910 | Always complaining aren't you?
1295 | 2921 | 2920 | RowBots normally stick around the canal. Funny that.
1296 | 2885 | 2884 | Blerontin.
1297 | 2899 | 2898 | There aren't any. Cross your legs can't you?
1298 | 2901 | 2900 | Look, nobody's perfect. They got forgotten. You'll just have to cope.
1299 | 2903 | 2902 | We were going to Vastan. Now we're just drifting out of control.
1300 | 2905 | 2904 | Mislaid is a more polite way of putting it.
1301 | 3447 | 3446 | The BarBot.
1302 | 3439 | 3438 | The BellBot.
1303 | 3413 | 3412 | Brobostigon.
1304 | 3405 | 3404 | Star Struct Incorporated. Not that it's any business of yours.
1305 | 3431 | 3430 | D'Astragaar.
1306 | 3449 | 3448 | The DeskBot.
1307 | 3441 | 3440 | The DoorBot.
1308 | 3427 | 3426 | Fentible.
1309 | 3451 | 3450 | Fortillian Bantoburn O'Perfluous.
1310 | 3417 | 3416 | The Gat.
1311 | 3423 | 3422 | Krage.
1312 | 3411 | 3410 | Leovinus.
1313 | 3445 | 3444 | The LiftBot.
1314 | 3429 | 3428 | Marsinta.
1315 | 3419 | 3418 | Me.
1316 | 3425 | 3424 | Nobby.
1317 | 3407 | 3406 | Starlight Lines - satisfied?
1318 | 3433 | 3432 | The Parrot.
1319 | 3443 | 3442 | The RowBot.
1320 | 3415 | 3414 | Scraliontis.
1321 | 3435 | 3434 | Shorbert.
1322 | 3437 | 3436 | The Succ-U-Bus.
1323 | 3409 | 3408 | Titania.
1324 | 3421 | 3420 | You.
1325 | 2699 | 2698 | What do I care?
1326 | 1421 | 1420 | The bar's empty because - there's nobody in it.
1327 | 1423 | 1422 | There's nobody in it - because there are no passengers.
1328 | 2755 | 2754 | You're an easy target that's why.
1329 | 3395 | 3394 | Nothing. You wouldn't find it funny.
1330 | 3397 | 3396 | Really. You wouldn't understand.
1331 | 3399 | 3398 | You wouldn't get it. OK? Just leave it. Forget it.
1332 | 3401 | 3400 | FORGET IT! ALL RIGHT?! IT NEVER HAPPENED!
1333 | 2691 | 2690 | Because my Cellpoint is set at unpleasant.
1334 | 2757 | 2756 | Just the way I'm programmed I guess. I kinda like it.
1335 | 3275 | 3274 | Wrong.
1336 | 2701 | 2700 | Funny, that's just what I think of you.
1337 | 2639 | 2638 | That's my business - all right?
1338 | 2651 | 2650 | I'll tell you what I like. Any Bar without you in it.
1339 | 3309 | 3308 | It's my sandwiches.
1340 | 3307 | 3306 | It's a transparent parrot-sized battle-helmet.
1341 | 3321 | 3320 | It's a plinth used for displaying the internal organs of customers who displease me.
1342 | 3313 | 3312 | It's an instrument for hooking peanuts out of Bot's ears.
1343 | 3315 | 3314 | It's a tiny angel.
1344 | 3317 | 3316 | It's a piece of leather, vital for the popular game of pouch thronging.
1345 | 3319 | 3318 | It's a device for removing brains from the skulls of unwanted guests.
1346 | 3311 | 3310 | It's a finger protector.
1347 | 3297 | 3296 | It's a bar.
1348 | 3279 | 3278 | It's a bell.
1349 | 3287 | 3286 | It's the way out.
1350 | 3277 | 3276 | It's a glass.
1351 | 3293 | 3292 | It's the list of ingredients for the Titanic Titillator.
1352 | 3291 | 3290 | It's the cocktail monitor.
1353 | 3299 | 3298 | It's that damn parrot again.
1354 | 3289 | 3288 | It's the Pellerator.
1355 | 3283 | 3282 | It's a picture.
1356 | 3295 | 3294 | It's a Succ-U-Bus.
1357 | 3281 | 3280 | It's a Vision Center.
1358 | 3285 | 3284 | It's somebody's idea of tasteful wallpaper.
1359 | 3859 | 3858 | Mmm. Deeply uninteresting.
1360 | 1803 | 1802 | No time - it's work, work work for me.
1361 | 2095 | 2094 | We're already there.
1362 | 1865 | 1864 | Interested in weather are you?
1363 | 1867 | 1866 | You'd like the Arboretum.
1364 | 1869 | 1868 | Ah well, I wouldn't like to spoil the surprise.
1365 | 1871 | 1870 | You ought to take a gander at the Arboretum - that might change your mind.
1366 | 2571 | 2570 | Nasty weather. Nasty mess I'm in too.
1367 | 2569 | 2568 | Nice weather - but nasty mess I'm in all right.
1368 | 1853 | 1852 | Fortillian Bantoburn O'Perfluous at your service. Welcome to the Starship Titanic, Bar of Bars. And what can I get you?
1369 | 3639 | 3638 | That's the cocktail menu server monitor.
1370 | 3641 | 3640 | It serves the cocktail menus to me. I serve the cocktails to you. The wonders of modern cyberscience, eh? Except it's serving up some right nonsense at the moment.
1371 | 3643 | 3642 | It's all got a bit garbled. But a BarBot's got to mix what a BarBot's got to mix.
1372 | 1935 | 1934 | Last time I looked - an extensive array of exotic beverages.
1373 | 2327 | 2326 | The usual - shelves, bottles, amphorae, Vision Center, glasses.
1374 | 1883 | 1882 | I'm the BarBot. What line are you in?
1375 | 1849 | 1848 | Are you crazy? There is no point.
1376 | 3765 | 3764 | Ninety smorbits.
1377 | 3767 | 3766 | A ninetieth of a bibbit.
1378 | 1927 | 1926 | DeskBot's in the Embarkation Lobby.
1379 | 2289 | 2288 | I don't know. Perhaps you should look for a fuse box?
1380 | 2293 | 2292 | Perhaps somebody took them for safe keeping?
1381 | 2295 | 2294 | Bots aren't allowed into Titania's room. They fall off the ceiling.
1382 | 2297 | 2296 | Leovinus, Scraliontis, Brobostigon for example.
1383 | 2291 | 2290 | The ship is controlled from Titania's room. I expect the fuse box is around there somewhere.
1384 | 1925 | 1924 | LiftBot's in the lifts - like me, he doesn't get around much.
1385 | 1931 | 1930 | Maitre D'Bot doesn't move from the 1st Class Restaurant.
1386 | 1923 | 1922 | All you have to do is call him. Use your PET.
1387 | 1919 | 1918 | Well, we were on our way to Vastan to pick up our first passengers, but we got slightly lost.
1388 | 1929 | 1928 | RowBots normally stick around the canal.
1389 | 1907 | 1906 | Don't ask me why, but there isn't one here.
1390 | 1909 | 1908 | I can only assume they forgot about them when they built the ship. Still that's what maiden voyages are for - finding all those little mistakes.
1391 | 3525 | 3524 | I've got a bottle of finest Signurian Vodka right here. I'll whip up a shot for you as soon as I finish this Titanic Titillator.
1392 | 3527 | 3526 | I've got a bottle of finest Signurian Vodka right here. Obviously, being Signurian, it has to go into the cocktail last.
1393 | 1911 | 1910 | We were headed for Vastan, but now I think we're a wee bit lost.
1394 | 1913 | 1912 | Nothing serious. Just drifting, out of control through the dark void of space.
1395 | 1903 | 1902 | Blerontin.
1396 | 2047 | 2046 | Whistling.
1397 | 2615 | 2614 | The BarBot.

1421 | 1737 | 1736 | Why?
1422 | 1733 | 1732 | Why not?
1423 | 3697 | 3696 | Yes.
1424 | 3699 | 3698 | Yes.
1425 | 3701 | 3700 | Yes.
1426 | 3703 | 3702 | Yes.
1427 | 3705 | 3704 | Oh, yes.
1428 | 3731 | 3730 | Yeah.
1429 | 3739 | 3738 | Yeah.
1430 | 3741 | 3740 | Yes.
1431 | 3637 | 3636 | You would think so, wouldn't you?
1432 | 1679 | 1678 | Oh, you get no time to fancy in this business.
1433 | 3579 | 3578 | I don't lie. I always tell the truth.
1434 | 3581 | 3580 | I don't tell lies. The BellBot tells lies.
1435 | 3583 | 3582 | I don't lie. The DoorBot is a liar. Not me.
1436 | 1691 | 1690 | I like anything that doesn't involve mopping up afterwards.
1437 | 947 | 946 | Do you think a flying fish display would go down well with the guests? Trouble is when they power down they can make quite a mess. A bit of music would help but I don't know how we get them fellas down from the music room. Perhaps a few games: I could set up a Gargle-Blatting alley but we'd need to provide a sweatbox; there's Flingy of course but there's not much room for a run-up and tempers can get raised; there's Pouch-Thronging but that can get out of hand and the last thing we need is a visit from the Belt Morality Testers. Ah well, maybe it's not to be... Now what was that you were saying? Ah yes.
1438 | 609 | 608 | No I've not but I think they keep one in the First Class Restaurant.
1439 | 431 | 430 | If my responses have been in any way unsatisfactory, I shall have them rectified immediately.
1440 | 7 | 6 | Well if I were you I'd drop it in the Canal.
1441 | 27 | 26 | Very decent of you I'm sure. I prefer my starling puree as a body rub.
1442 | 535 | 534 | I'm mixing this cocktail for the very eminent and distinguished Mister Leovinus. Not merely the most charming of gentlemen - but also as it happens, a veritable prince among tippers.
1443 | 573 | 572 | Aaah. I'm afraid I wouldn't have anything of that nature here.
1444 | 555 | 554 | Ah for sure you just missed him. He walked out of that door not five nanoseconds before you came in. I'm sure it was nothing personal.
1445 | 51 | 50 | I have to be honest with ya: I'd be lying if I told ya I was telling the truth.
1446 | 53 | 52 | I have to be honest with ya: I'd be lying if I told ya I wasn't telling you the truth.
1447 | 55 | 54 | I have to be honest with ya: I'd be lying if I told ya I was telling you the truth.
1448 | 73 | 72 | Thank you for your comment which I shall pass on to the management: I can assure you I'm as fit as a futtle.
1449 | 89 | 88 | Well I'm pleased to hear that: you'll find money's very useful on this ship.
1450 | 501 | 500 | I'll be finished in just one second.
1451 | 465 | 464 | It would be my absolute pleasure.
1452 | 109 | 108 | Well it couldn't be easier: you get to the Promenade Deck via the Grand Canal.
1453 | 337 | 336 | Take the glass and go to the Arboretum.
1454 | 339 | 338 | Take the glass and go to the Art Gallery.
1455 | 341 | 340 | Take the glass and go to the Music Room.
1456 | 513 | 512 | A truly excellent suggestion. To be perfectly honest, I doubt the riffraff element could tell the difference between a cocktail and a cockatiel anyway.
1457 | 343 | 342 | Take the glass and go to the Parrot Lobby.
1458 | 333 | 332 | Well that couldn't be easier.
1459 | 335 | 334 | Take the glass and go to the First Class Restaurant.
1460 | 589 | 588 | Oh, my sainted krypto-Aunt - how remiss of me. You don't need to puree them at all! Jars of Arcturan Sun-Dried Starling Puree are readily available from the First Class Restaurant.
1461 | 317 | 316 | Very interesting. I do find you so full of wonderful ideas.
1462 | 711 | 710 | Well yes, I think you're right. You'd better get along there straight away.
1463 | 133 | 132 | Fret not my friend. The starling puree can now be found in the Arboretum.
1464 | 155 | 154 | My but I do admire your endeavor. Soon we can have a Titanic Titillator. It's my favorite.
1465 | 157 | 156 | My but I do admire your endeavor. Soon we can have a Titanic Titillator. Ah. Hmm! A Titanic Titillator. It's my favorite.
1466 | 183 | 182 | You're a caring decent fellow but I wouldn't worry: the starlings positively enjoy it.
1467 | 411 | 410 | Oh yes tea you'll find we've got plenty of tea. I'll make you a little pot right away.
1468 | 205 | 204 | You just say what you feel and don't worry about me: my shrinkware tells me that the problem here is not my bar but your opinion of it.
1469 | 395 | 394 | How could any fellow POSSIBLY refuse such a charmingly phrased offer?
1470 | 225 | 224 | To be honest, it wouldn't hurt me - I always wear a throat guard on duty.
1471 | 481 | 480 | You'll not find a TV on this ship oh no.
1472 | 447 | 446 | Ah well now that's an easy one. Pop down to Marsinta at check-in and ask her if she could have one delivered to your room.
1473 | 727 | 726 | On the contrary it's rather a surprising little fellow - muted color, deep mango hints and a kick like a Barrolingian fighting dog.
1474 | 373 | 372 | Certainly, coming right up.
1475 | 257 | 256 | I'm glad you're interested: I am mixing equal quantities of heavy water and light ale in the hope of creating a medium dry white.
1476 | 777 | 776 | I'd get back to your room and wait there - I've a funny feeling luck's going to come knocking at your door...
1477 | 827 | 826 | Well now if I were you I'd check out the restaurants.
1478 | 811 | 810 | The thing with starlings is they migrate South this time of year. So you'll most likely be finding them in the Bilge Room.
1479 | 279 | 278 | I wouldn't worry about that; you'll find one in your bedroom.
1480 | 299 | 298 | Another brilliantly insightful question if you don't mind me saying: the great Scraliontis ordered it last night when he came in.
1481 | 605 | 604 | Sadly I've nothing in the bar which might meet your requirements.
1482 | 429 | 428 | Look buddy, this is my bar and I'll do what I like in it Capisce?
1483 | 1 | 0 | Well if I were you I'd drop it in the Well.
1484 | 23 | 22 | You're a decent fella you are but I have to decline; I never touch the stuff.
1485 | 531 | 530 | I'm mixing this cocktail for the very eminent and distinguished Mister Brobostigon. Not merely the most charming of gentlemen - but also as it happens, a veritable prince among tippers.
1486 | 787 | 786 | You're a genius so you are. Well now, hang onto your hat and let's mix cocktails!
1487 | 569 | 568 | One glass. At your service.
1488 | 551 | 550 | Leovinus? I've not seen him for weeks.
1489 | 47 | 46 | I've got to be honest: I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't telling you the truth.
1490 | 69 | 68 | Thank you for your comment which I shall pass on to the management: I must admit, I am feeling a wee bit unnecessary today.
1491 | 83 | 82 | Well I'm pleased to hear that but money's not important on this ship.
1492 | 497 | 496 | Ah well I'd love be going quicker me self but I seem to be stuck making this little cocktail.
1493 | 461 | 460 | I'm afraid that won't be possible. Might I tempt you instead to my specialty, the Titanic Titillator? It won't take long to rustle up.
1494 | 103 | 102 | Well it couldn't be easier: you get to the Promenade Deck via the Pellerator.
1495 | 329 | 328 | Well that couldn't be easier. Take the glass and go to the Super Galactic Traveler Restaurant.
1496 | 509 | 508 | I'm afraid this recipe is VERY clear about the starling element. Pureed parrot, you see, is only ever used in the mixing of RUM-based beverages. Stands to reason when you think about it.
1497 | 585 | 584 | Well now that's a tricky one. You'd need a big blender for a job like that.
1498 | 313 | 312 | Very interesting. I must admit I have not heard of the individual in question.
1499 | 707 | 706 | Well now, I'm no ornithologist. But if it's starling puree you're after I suspect you'll be wanting a room with some kind of a tap.
1500 | 709 | 708 | Well now from memory I suspect the SGT Restaurant could be a good place to start.
1501 | 129 | 128 | Fret not, my friend. The starling puree can now be found in the Super Galactic Traveler Restaurant.
1502 | 149 | 148 | Oh yes? I'll take your word for it. I've never seen a pureed flock of starlings before.
1503 | 179 | 178 | Yes it's a nasty job but someone's got to do it.
1504 | 407 | 406 | I'm so sorry the answer's no I'm afraid.
1505 | 199 | 198 | Well I'm sorry you feel like that, I'm proud of this bar.
1506 | 391 | 390 | Now, now, if I weren't to know better I might go taking that as some sort of veiled threat.
1507 | 219 | 218 | To be honest, it would hurt.
1508 | 477 | 476 | You'll find TV sets throughout the ship - a whole galaxy of entertainment at your fingertips.
1509 | 443 | 442 | A minor task. You simply get some TV sets and then you crush them.
1510 | 725 | 724 | I couldn't agree with you more. The starlings don't like it much either.
1511 | 237 | 236 | Certainly just as soon as I've finished mixing this cocktail.
1512 | 369 | 368 | I'm all a-jangle with the anticipation of serving you -but I'm afraid you'll have to wait till I've finished this.
1513 | 253 | 252 | I'm glad you're interested: I am mixing a cocktail called the Titanic Titillator.
1514 | 743 | 742 | A slug of Signurian Vodka, a slice of lemon, a crushed TV set and a pureed flock of starlings.
1515 | 771 | 770 | Enjoy the ship - that's what it's here for.
1516 | 823 | 822 | Well now I'd suggest looking for a lemon tree.
1517 | 807 | 806 | The thing with starlings is they migrate South this time of year. So you'll most likely be finding them on the Promenade Deck.
1518 | 273 | 272 | Sorry to disappoint you but the only starlings I know are up on the Promenade Deck.
1519 | 283 | 282 | You see the only starlings I know are up on the Promenade Deck and they're purely ornamental.
1520 | 291 | 290 | Another brilliantly insightful question if you don't mind me saying: the mighty Brobostigon ordered it last night when he came in.
1521 | 759 | 758 | Sorry about that. I was lying through what remains of my teeth. Damn this metal corrosion.
1522 | 691 | 690 | State of the art - that's what they say about Titania. Most sophisticated cyberintelligence ever created - runs the whole ship.
1523 | 937 | 936 | I had a body once you know - Very messy it was, needed lots of maintenance, everything you did involved wiping, always wiping. Very unreliable. Since I got scanned though and worked my way up to the Halycon Multimix Ironymaster that you see in front of you I've been a very happy bot. No smells, no embarrassments, no sudden urges that have to be contained. Occasionally I get a little whiff of pleasure if I go too near a power unit, but I can handle it. Anyway I mustn't bore you... You were just now asking me something... Ay yes.
1524 | 611 | 610 | We don't have one here but I know they have one in the First Class Restaurant. Not that you'll have the intelligence to get there.
1525 | 433 | 432 | There's nothing wrong with the way I talk my friend and if you really have problems with it, I suggest you get off at the next stop.
1526 | 5 | 4 | Can you work out nothing for yourself weasel brain? Drop it in the Canal.
1527 | 29 | 28 | Very kind of you but I must decline: I never accept offers from customers I despise.
1528 | 537 | 536 | Not that it's any of your bilge-belching business, but I happen to be making this drink for a Mister Scraliontis.
1529 | 575 | 574 | What do you think this is - a bar or something? We haven't got any.
1530 | 557 | 556 | Ah for sure you just missed him. He walked out of that door not five nanoseconds before you came in. Not that he would have stopped to talk to you.
1531 | 57 | 56 | You insult me but I shall not be provoked: I'd be lying if I told you I was telling you the truth.
1532 | 59 | 58 | You insult me but I shall not be provoked: I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't telling you the truth.
1533 | 75 | 74 | When I want your opinion I'll ask for it duck-face. The only thing wrong with me is the headache I've got listening to you.
1534 | 87 | 86 | Reduced to bragging now are we? You'll find money's very useful on this ship.
1535 | 499 | 498 | I find it astonishing that you want me to go quicker when your own evolution has so clearly gone at a snail's pace.
1536 | 467 | 466 | If it'll stop your incessant drivel for even half a picosecond, I'd be delighted to.
1537 | 107 | 106 | You get to the Promenade Deck via the Grand Canal, and the sooner you're out of my sight the better.
1538 | 349 | 348 | Take the glass and go to the Arboretum.
1539 | 351 | 350 | Take the glass and go to the Art Gallery.
1540 | 353 | 352 | Take the glass and go to the Music Room.
1541 | 515 | 514 | That flea bitten feather bag must surely rank as the only creature on this entire ship whose conversation I find even more boring and repetitive than your own. Go ahead, puree it.
1542 | 355 | 354 | Take the glass and go to the Parrot Lobby.
1543 | 345 | 344 | Well that couldn't be easier. Even for a pultronic idiot such as yourself.
1544 | 347 | 346 | Take the glass and go to the First Class Restaurant.
1545 | 591 | 590 | Frankly I can't be bothered to explain anything as mind-numbingly simple as basic liquidizing techniques to the likes of you. Although I suspect you might find the phrase "Giant Fan" to be somewhat pertinent.
1546 | 319 | 318 | Bit of a name-dropper aren't we?
1547 | 715 | 714 | Well for once mutton-head you seem to have got the right answer. You'd better get down there straight away before your luck changes.
1548 | 723 | 722 | If you're not using the cerebrum for intelligent thought, I wonder if I could borrow it later to swab down the bar? There's only one place on this ship where I've seen anything remotely capable of delivering pureed starlings and that's exactly the room you've just mentioned. Sorry about that, I just so enjoy insulting you it's impossible to give you good news straight.
1549 | 135 | 134 | You are useless at this. Look, if it's starling puree you're after, I'd try the Arboretum.
1550 | 159 | 158 | You're pushing your luck sunshine. This isn't pureed starling. It's pureed hamster you evil rodent reducer.
1551 | 161 | 160 | Alright, I'll let you off. But only if you say I'm the nicest BarBot you've ever met.
1552 | 165 | 164 | I suppose you think I'll suddenly be nice to you if you come on all tough. Well think again worm.
1553 | 163 | 162 | You really are a fawning little toad aren't you. Of all the creeps on all the planets you're right up there with the real squirmers.
1554 | 185 | 184 | Shows how little you know: the starlings positively enjoy it.
1555 | 413 | 412 | This is a BAR d'ya understand? We serve DRINKS FOR ADULTS! DRINKS FOR REAL MEN! DRINKS FOR REAL WOMEN! And you ask me for tea. Is there no end to this indignity? All right, I'll make your tea you little wuss!
1556 | 203 | 202 | Your mindless vitriol affects me not one jot: your opinions are about as useful as hemorrhoids on a jockey.
1557 | 397 | 396 | Since you put it like that potato face, nothing would fill me with greater pleasure than to comply.
1558 | 223 | 222 | What could you possibly do to me mutton brain: it wouldn't hurt me.
1559 | 483 | 482 | You're a sloth what are you? Five minutes you've been on this ship and you want to slink off to watch TV. Well tough cos. there aren't any on the ship.
1560 | 449 | 448 | Just this once you bag of bones and water I'll tell you: go down to the DeskBot and ask her very very nicely to send one to your room.
1561 | 731 | 730 | How little you know about the mysterious art of the cocktail BarBot. This drink is a delight, a wonder, a creation and you are not worthy to speak its name.
1562 | 241 | 240 | Welcome to Eejit Happy Hour, I think you'll feel quite at home. If you're after the vision center I think you'll find it in the Arboretum. It's not a trinket kept in a bar.
1563 | 375 | 374 | Anything to distract that busy little thorax of yours - I'll pour you one straight away.
1564 | 259 | 258 | It's got bugger all to do with you but: I am mixing equal quantities of heavy water and light ale in the hope of creating a medium dry white.
1565 | 775 | 774 | If I were you I'd head back to your room and wait for something to happen because the chances of you getting anything right on your own are zilch.
1566 | 829 | 828 | You really are quite dim aren't you. Try the restaurants, that's the obvious place.
1567 | 813 | 812 | Do I LOOK like the sort of fella with time to waste on idle ornithological observations? They could be taking a bracing mid-morning stroll along the Grand Axial Canal for all I know.
1568 | 277 | 276 | It grieves me to have to help you: you'll find one in your bedroom.
1569 | 303 | 302 | Me, potato face.
1570 | 301 | 300 | Try engaging a few neurons in that bread basket you call a head: I'm making it for someone to drink.
1571 | 607 | 606 | It gives me great pleasure to inform you that I have none.
1572 | 427 | 426 | I apologize profusely for any confusion caused, which I am sure, is entirely my fault.
1573 | 3 | 2 | Can you work out nothing for yourself you brainless divot? Drop it in the Well.
1574 | 25 | 24 | I suppose you think you're being funny; I can't imagine a more foul brew than starling puree.
1575 | 533 | 532 | Not that it's any of your bilge-belching business, but I happen to be making this drink for a Mister Brobostigon.
1576 | 789 | 788 | Well about time too. Now, step back. I've got a job to do.
1577 | 571 | 570 | One glass. No ice, no slice. If it's got slime on it you'll just have to lick it off.
1578 | 553 | 552 | The answer to that is quite patently none of your frog-frotting business. How should I know where he is - he's not been in the bar for weeks.
1579 | 49 | 48 | You nasty little worm, coming into my bar and calling me a liar. Well, I shall not be provoked: I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't telling you the truth.
1580 | 71 | 70 | You just can't keep your insidious opinions to yourself can you? If I'm not feeling well it's no business yours.
1581 | 85 | 84 | Reduced to bragging now are we? You really are a tasteless toad.
1582 | 495 | 494 | Why not pop back to your room and watch it there.
1583 | 463 | 462 | In a word sponge brain - no.
1584 | 105 | 104 | You get to the Promenade Deck via the Pellerator, and the sooner you're out of my sight the better.
1585 | 331 | 330 | You pathetic sniveling pseudo-replicant of intelligent life: take the glass and go to the Super Galactic Traveler Restaurant.
1586 | 511 | 510 | From your pea-brained view of the universe I'm sure there's little difference between a parrot and a starling - I think the parrot might take a different view.
1587 | 587 | 586 | Frankly I can't be bothered to explain anything as mind-numbingly simple as basic liquidizing techniques to the likes of you. Although I suspect you might find the phrase "fan-assisted" to be somewhat pertinent.
1588 | 315 | 314 | Bit of a name-dropper aren't we? As it happens I've never heard of them.
1589 | 713 | 712 | How should I know? I suggest you dose yourself up with a few brain cells and try and work it out for yourself.
1590 | 131 | 130 | My heart bleeds for you. Have you tried the Super Galactic Traveler Restaurant?
1591 | 151 | 150 | You're pushing your luck sunshine. For all I know this is pureed snipe.
1592 | 153 | 152 | Oh yes and I'm a monkey's coder. All right I believe you, but only because you're too pathetic to cheat me.
1593 | 181 | 180 | To be honest I'd much rather be pureeing you but sadly I'm programmed to resist that urge.
1594 | 409 | 408 | Tea? TEA? This is a BAR d'ya understand? We serve DRINKS FOR ADULTS! DRINKS FOR REAL MEN! DRINKS FOR REAL WOMEN! There'll be no tea served in this bar.
1595 | 201 | 200 | I don't give a rancid fig for your opinions: I'm proud of this bar.
1596 | 393 | 392 | Care to step outside? Because if you would, then as soon as I've finished mixing this, I'll personally assist your speedy exit through the nearest airlock with the help of a large plutonium crowbar.
1597 | 221 | 220 | What do you think would happen you dorf - it would hurt.
1598 | 479 | 478 | You're a sloth what are you? Five minutes you've been on this ship and you want to slink off to watch TV. Huh.
1599 | 445 | 444 | You may find this difficult to understand being of micro-brain: first you get yourself a TV set and then you crush it.
1600 | 729 | 728 | You're not qualified to pass judgement upon my little cocktail, but as it happens you're right.
1601 | 239 | 238 | Welcome to Eejit Happy Hour, I think you'll feel quite at home. The vision center is a highly sophisticated piece of equipment. I'll give it to you when I've finished making this cocktail but you'd better be careful with it.
1602 | 371 | 370 | Charmed as I'd be to help you attain an advanced state of pathetic, dribbling inebriation, it seems to have escaped your insectoid attention that I have more important tasks to finish.
1603 | 255 | 254 | It's got bogger all to do with you but as it happens I'm mixing a cocktail called the Titanic Titillator.
1604 | 745 | 744 | You nosey beggar. If you must know: A slug of Signurian Vodka, a slice of lemon, a crushed TV set and a pureed flock of starlings.
1605 | 773 | 772 | If I were you I'd look around the ship and while you do so think on how you might improve yourself.
1606 | 825 | 824 | You really are quite dim aren't you. Try looking for a lemon tree.
1607 | 809 | 808 | Do I LOOK like the sort of fella with time to waste on idle ornithological observations? They could be taking a mid-morning stroll round the Promenade Deck for all I know.
1608 | 275 | 274 | I so enjoy giving you bad news: there's a few starlings knocking about the Promenade Deck but that's all I know.
1609 | 297 | 296 | Mr. Brobostigon to you. He was the Project Manager for the ship.
1610 | 295 | 294 | My but you're a nosy pittock - Brobostigon asked me to.
1611 | 293 | 292 | Why not engage a few neurons in that bread basket you call a head - somebody asked me to.
1612 | 761 | 760 | I enjoyed that. I do hope you wasted some time. I was spitefully and maliciously lying at the time - it's an occasional condition which I'm beginning to enjoy.
1613 | 693 | 692 | Don't talk to me about Titania. Used to be such a nice girl - completely gone to pieces since we left Blerontin.
1614 | 961 | 960 | My but you've some strong language on you.
1615 | 963 | 962 | I'm terribly grateful for that comment sir but I would advise a little caution in the profanity department.
1616 | 965 | 964 | Please do not swear at the BarBots it may embarrass them.
1617 | 967 | 966 | BarBots may be prone to shut-down at certain sustained obscenity levels.
1618 | 985 | 984 | Well now you won't hear me using language like that.
1619 | 987 | 986 | My you're a one for the strong language aren't you?
1620 | 989 | 988 | Oh now you're making me blush.
1621 | 991 | 990 | You'll be showing me your tattoos next won't you.
1622 | 993 | 992 | You're a proper devil with those naughty words now aren't you.
1623 | 943 | 942 | You know you'd never believe it to look at me but I was once quite a big thing in TV - I was a pixel inspector on a DIY movie chat line. Well I can tell you, if I'd had stalks my eyes would have popped out on them. I only lasted a few days - total burn out. Since then I've been re-foliated and I've lost all interest in hot metal. I've no regrets though... Now what were you saying before I so rudely interrupted. Oh yes.
1624 | 959 | 958 | I wonder now have you been down to that dismal establishment they call the Super Galactic Traveler Class Restaurant? I expect you're familiar with the place, they DO tend to cater for the more riff-raffish end of the social spectrum. No culture at all in that godforsaken place... unless you count what's growing on the food. I mean call me picky, call me faddy but unless they've employed the services of the galaxy's foremost genetic engineers, I don't expect to find fur on a chicken. Just take my advice and avoid the deep fried nuggets, that's all I can say. Anyway you were asking me something. Ah yes now...
1625 | 921 | 920 | Don't you just love chickens? To think that for thousands of years we all thought they were just plain dumb! Well that was some surprise, the day that giant roasting tin popped through the atmosphere and the GrandMaster Chicken hopped out. Wanted to know how the chickens had been treated while he was away. I was working at the time as a guidance system on a Chicken Surprise Farm. I thought we were in for trouble that night. But you were asking after something...
1626 | 923 | 922 | SO where was I? Oh yes the chicken farm. Anyway, I hung around with the StuffBots and we all watched as the chickens trooped off to the canteen to vote. "This house holds that it's better to be roasted nicely with a few spuds than it is to worry about evolving and setting up a civilization". There was only one vote against (a radical turkey had sneaked in at the back). Five minutes later they were back in the queue grinning ear to ear demanding to be wrung and stuffed. What a day. Ah well.
1627 | 917 | 916 | Did I ever tell you I was there with the great Babalanians when they won The Blood-Filled Gourd? I was a lowly auto hatchet at first - but as the day wore on I got meself belt-clipped to the great Clem Grunt. I was in awe. Clem had just broken all transfer records. Patrick had not only put three lunar funworlds on the table, they'd also agreed to the ritual sacrifice of five thousand supporters. And this was his first game. But I digress. What was that you were saying?
1628 | 945 | 944 | Do you know what I'm doing now? I'm exercising my suave upper torso in preparation for my starring role in the Grand Crossing The Line Ceremony. During the festivities we Bots are given full license to hunt down the most annoying passengers. After capturing the little beggars the crew are provided with giant slings with which to fire them from the aft deck towards the nearest star. Now that's what I call entertainment. But how rude of me. You had a question. Ah yes.
1629 | 791 | 790 | That's perfect. All I need now is a chicken garnish.
1630 | 793 | 792 | Well thanks, I didn't need it actually. I was lying. And as it happens, I'm not going to make the cocktail now. It's too late.
1631 | 747 | 746 | Ah well now that's a secret, sorry.
1632 | 695 | 694 | Titania? She's just the statue at the top of the Grand Central well.
1633 | 795 | 794 | Aren't you the clever one. Shame you forgot the chicken garnish. You'd better go and get it dumb-butt.
1634 | 797 | 796 | Fell for that one didn't you. I didn't need it actually. I was lying. I'm not going to make the cocktail now. It's too late.
1635 | 749 | 748 | Why should I tell you, you nosey beggar. Anyway it's a secret.
1636 | 769 | 768 | Not impressed with my travel recommendations, eh? Might I offer this one instead then? Frog off. If you really want to know why I suggested you visit that room, it's very simple. I was evidently suffering a temporary memory lapse. It happens to most mechanoids of my age: decelerating metal decline.
1637 | 697 | 696 | You are beneath contempt. Been in the bar five minutes and you're after picking up women. Well Titania doesn't exist. She's a statue. Capisce?
1638 | 899 | 898 | What's your view of facial hair I wonder - on a woman? My mother now had a full beard and a very fine accessory it was. Tailor-made mind you, not off the peg. We sent off for it after seeing some write-ups in Tache Galactica. You know, she never looked back once it was fitted. Didn't look forward much either come to think of it. Of course it's not so fashionable now, most youngsters draw the line at a fine display of ear hair, or maybe a few nose curls but I do miss the drama of those days. But I digress...
1639 | 925 | 924 | Ever been fishing? The peace, the quiet. The scent of new-mown hay, the sound of little birds nesting. The warm, gentle sun of a summer afternoon, tiny insects hovering, dipping, skating on the surface of the water. I hate all that. No, fishing to me means combat, life or death struggles, heart-pounding, axe-wielding bloody battles, up to your neck in icy water with a giant Wetback throwing punches, desperate moments when a knee-spike threatens your throat, those big furry claws tearing at your limbs, that glorious sensation when you roll back onto dry land and the lob-bomb go off. That's a sport to make you feel alive eh? But I'm getting off the point here. What was it you asked me? Oh yes now.
1640 | 841 | 840 | Can you not see there's a bot in trouble here? Give us a hand with this cocktail will you.
1641 | 859 | 858 | Good. Have a good butchers at that cocktail list and see what you can do.
1642 | 861 | 860 | Fair enough. If you've no sense of decency then I've no wish to talk to you anyway.
1643 | 863 | 862 | I've got starling puree, now get me lemons and crushed TV's.
1644 | 865 | 864 | I've got starling puree and lemons. Now get me crushed TV's.
1645 | 867 | 866 | I've got starling puree and TV's. Now get me lemons.
1646 | 869 | 868 | I've got crushed TV's. Now get me starling puree and lemons.
1647 | 871 | 870 | I've got crushed TV's and lemons. Now get me starling puree.
1648 | 873 | 872 | I've got lemons. Now get me crushed TV's and starling puree.
1649 | 875 | 874 | Where's the ingredients for this cocktail - that's more important.
1650 | 877 | 876 | Where's Leovinus? He'd fix this little mess, no problem.
1651 | 843 | 842 | Until I have completed this cocktailian task I have no time for idle chatter.
1652 | 879 | 878 | When are you going to get off your backside and give us a bit of help?
1653 | 881 | 880 | When am I going to get someone who knows what they're doing in here?
1654 | 883 | 882 | Don't ask me. If I knew that I wouldn't be stuck here like this. Give us a hand can't you?
1655 | 885 | 884 | Why did it have to be me?
1656 | 887 | 886 | Who's going to sort out Brobostigon and Scraliontis - that's what I want to know. They seem to be responsible for most of what's gone wrong round here.
1657 | 889 | 888 | To be honest I don't really care. All I care about is what help you're going to give me.
1658 | 891 | 890 | Who knows: There's more important things to worry about. Such as me.
1659 | 893 | 892 | How should I know? I'm just a lovely BarBot trapped in a fiendish cocktail predicament.
1660 | 845 | 844 | Help us out with this cocktail will you, then we'll have time for a chat.
1661 | 847 | 846 | This is no time for discourse - this is a time for action: get me starling puree, get me TV's, get me lemons. Get me out of this mess.
1662 | 849 | 848 | Look - I've no time for idle chatter. I've a cocktail to make here.
1663 | 851 | 850 | Never mind that. Have you no sense of charity - I'm in great need of a helping hand here.
1664 | 853 | 852 | Holy Kaboli. Are you just going to gawk and make inane comments? Look at the cocktail menu and get to work why don't you?
1665 | 855 | 854 | It's a fiendish look I'm in here - and you're my only hope of getting out of it. Is there nothing you can do?
1666 | 857 | 856 | You help me - then I'll talk to you. Is that a deal?
1667 | 929 | 928 | Gravity's a bit light today don't you think? If it carries on like this we could be in for quite a weekend. Nowhere worse than a bar in a gravity storm as I'm sure you know, clears the place faster than a Racatan in a Glabian Leisure Pool. Ah well back to work. You were asking me something. Ah yes.
1668 | 933 | 932 | To be honest I've not been feeling myself recently. You know what I need? A holiday. There's a little health farm on the outer rim of Skopolopoloi that's the nearest thing I know to virtual heaven. A couple of weeks there and I'd come home a new bot, sleek, shiny, top of the range neutral upgrade, the old bonhomie reservoir cleaned and re-filled. But there I go again dreaming. Where were we? You had a question for me. Oh yes.
1669 | 81 | 80 | Well isn't this just a case of the pot calling the kettle black. You're an embarrassment to your species: if I were you I would disembark at the next port, find the local Customs House, ask them to extract your genetic coding, and insist they destroy it in the name of all intelligent life. We must not risk your accidental replication whilst while you are absent from your home planet. You are the most abnormal creature I ever scanned. It is absurd that you should question my state. Only I can do that. And I'm going to. There. I just did. And on reflection: yes, I appear to be going mad. Let's change the subject.
1670 | 321 | 320 | Well isn't it a funny thing the number of people I meet who think that just because I work in a bar I must have met everyone in the galaxy who's plied the same trade. If only it were true. Now just give me a minute while I do a wee spot of brain racking.
1671 | 617 | 616 | I know where you'll find one - in the first class restaurant.
1672 | 437 | 436 | I apologize profusely for any confusion but I'm answering as best as is humanly possible. Which considering that I'm not, in fact, human - represents a significant personal achievement. Far be it from me to consider - to even consider CONSIDERING - the upsetting of one of my valued clientele with a dishonest or unnecessarily long-winded, verbose, tautological or otherwise-less-than-satisfactory reply. Starting immediately I'll cut my replies back ruthlessly. With immediate effect. From right now. This minute. This very second.
1673 | 13 | 12 | Well, if you're really determined to have a bit of fun, then I won't stand in your way. Who am I to be judge and jury. Anyway, I digress. The best way I know to crush a TV would be to drop it down the well.
1674 | 15 | 14 | Still, if you're really determined to have a bit of fun then I won't stand in your way. Who am I to be judge and jury? Anyway, I digress. The best way I know to crush a TV set would be to get the parrot to squash it in his beak.
1675 | 35 | 34 | Thanks for the offer but I only drink pureed starling with a cherry on the top.
1676 | 37 | 36 | The best place to find cherries is by the DeskBot. Marsinta has a secret stash.
1677 | 541 | 540 | OR in fact the fellow I was talking about - Mr. Leovinus.
1678 | 579 | 578 | Now, where did I put them don't tell me. don't tell me. next to the pickled walnuts, wasn't it ? No? Did I put them next to the swizzle sticks with the novelty figure of Titania on the end? Or did I put it with that framed photograph of Jargranthur Pynjj - legendary inventor of the fully-automatic, reflex-action, pushbutton-operated cocktail umbrella. Ah no, I remember now. We don't have any. Sorry.
1679 | 561 | 560 | Of course, I know where he'll be - picking lemons in the Arboretum.
1680 | 79 | 78 | Certainly not.
1681 | 95 | 94 | So you can see: your money's going to be very useful on this ship.
1682 | 471 | 470 | Would you like to try my specialty - the Titanic Titillator? Well. I say specialty, I haven't actually succeeded in making one yet, but had I succeeded, I can assure you this drink would be renowned throughout the universe as one of the most exquisite concoctions ever to have, hypothetically as it were enchanted the gullet, gills or primitive osmotic membrane of any organism fortunate enough to have supped on its ambrosial delights. Oh yes. The Titanic Titillator. Probably the best cocktail in the known worlds. Probably. I suspect. Tricky one to mix though, believe you me. Can't seem to get the ingredients. Anyway, that thing you wanted me to get - I'll do it right away.
1683 | 117 | 116 | But anyway, where were we? Best way to get to the Promenade deck. Via the canal I think. Oh yes it's the ride of a lifetime so I'm told though I've not had much opportunity to go exploring what with this cocktail to mix but it's a life of sacrifice so it is and somebody has to do it.
1684 | 361 | 360 | Take the glass and go to the Embarkation Lobby.
1685 | 521 | 520 | Funnily enough in the cocktail almanac parrots and starlings are inter changeable. So, go ahead.
1686 | 597 | 596 | Have you tried putting the starlings in the Succ-U-Bus?
1687 | 323 | 322 | You're not the first person to make the observation and I always take it as a compliment.
1688 | 701 | 700 | Now, it's odd you should ask me that because I was only thinking the other day what a funny old thing it was that there should be that whopping great statue at the top of the well and me not know the reason for it. So I asked someone and do you know what they said? Fortillian, they said, it's a statue and that's all you need to know. It's no good you thinking you can go and change the world by asking questions and being interesting all the time. So I don't and I'm not. Titania is a statue. And that's that.
1689 | 141 | 140 | I'd pop down to the Bilge Room.
1690 | 169 | 168 | Well what a delight it is to welcome you back to this "Bar of Bars" as I like to call it. And what was it you said you had there - pureed starlings? I'll take your word for it. I've never seen a pureed flock of starlings before. Well, I say never. I do believe I may once have seen a fat Galag drinking some in a bar on Big Polluga but it could have been a fake. Talking of fakes, did I ever tell you about the time when a fella tried to pass off his mother as the Empress of Old Hibonio. Didn't count on me spotting the extra set of ears. Sorry, I digress. Why don't you see if you can find me a spoon to stir the thing with?
1691 | 171 | 170 | If I knew that I'd do it myself my old shipmate.
1692 | 191 | 190 | So don't you worry about the starlings they're happy to go when they're called.
1693 | 419 | 418 | -the short answer is - but of course I'll have your tea ready in a jiffy.
1694 | 211 | 210 | But you don't have to drink here, why not try out the bar at the other end of the ship?
1695 | 399 | 398 | Coming right up your loveliness. And what a pleasure it is to serve you. You know though, you should be careful what you say to folks in bars. Take the planet Cobnutz Two: the phrase "two small spritzers and a packet of salted cashews" actually translates into local dialect as "Cursed be all thy kin.
1696 | 231 | 230 | Actually nothing would happen - I always wear a throat guard on duty.
1697 | 489 | 488 | You'll find them all over the ship but if I were you I'd head for first class.
1698 | 455 | 454 | Pop down to Marsinta at check-in and ask her if she could have one delivered to your room. That's the easy way.
1699 | 737 | 736 | On the contrary it's rather a surprising little fellow - muted colors, deep mango hints and a kick like a Barrolingian fighting dog. You know now that I've made this little fellow I'm disinclined to lose the recipe. With the SlamBot finals coming up next year I think I could be onto a real winner here: innovation's the thing you know.
1700 | 245 | 244 | Oh what lovely words you do use. You've a voice like a favorite melody. Still it's an answer you're wanting isn't it. Hold your horses and let me think about. On second thoughts tie your horses up outside the saloon because they're upsetting the dancing girls. Ha ha my little joke now what was it you were saying? Oh yes, the vision center. To be honest I think you'll find the vision center on the Promenade Deck.
1701 | 381 | 380 | Anything to distract that busy little thorax of yours - I'll pour you one straight away. Right. Here we are - it's coming right up.
1702 | 265 | 264 | I'm having a bit of fun exercising my allegoric muscle.
1703 | 753 | 752 | Well now I'm glad you asked me that. Just once in a million years a recipe comes along which blows away the routine world of cocktails. I tell you - this little fella's cutting edge. There's no chopped chaffinches here. No pulverized pigeon. No blended budgie. Oh no. We're talking parrot puree, chicken giblets, pistachios and water. What a blend.
1704 | 785 | 784 | I'd be delighted to offer you assistance. Where better than a bar to find a new direction - although for most of my customers that tends to be horizontal. Anyway, let me have a little think about your predicament. There's not much in the BarBot crisis manual about this one I can tell you. You know what I'd do in your shoes? I'd head back to your room and let the answer just come to you.
1705 | 833 | 832 | Well now that's an interesting one. Your lemon's not exactly the king of fruits now is it and on a ship this size you could be looking for ever. That's if they managed to put any lemons on board before we hit hyperspace (which I doubt, 'cos believe you me lemons don't feature highly on most pre-flight checks) so where are you going to find one? Your best bet would be to look in the restaurants if you ask me.
1706 | 817 | 816 | Ah, looking to catch some starlings are you? Well, you know what they say. Bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Dependent on current interplanetary exchange rate mechanisms of course... Starlings you wanted wasn't it? Mmmm. Well not to beat about the bush, the thing with starlings is they migrate south this time of year. So you'll most likely be finding them in the Bilge Room.
1707 | 719 | 718 | Well now, I'm no ornithologist and I'm certainly no expert on the flight paths of pureed starlings. Metaphorically speaking of course but what do you expect from a BarBot? Anyway, around this time of year we see a lot of starling puree migrating to the very room you mentioned so if I were you I'd pop along there toot sweet and see what you can find.
1708 | 285 | 284 | Just my little joke. If it's starlings you're after your best bet is to go back to your room and look for them there.
1709 | 765 | 764 | Now why would I do that? Such an odd thing to do. So uncharitable. Still look on the bright side. It's just so picturesque there, this time of year, wouldn't you say? The beautiful bloom on the new... sheet-metal paneling quite makes the heart sing, that it does. Anyway, that little misunderstanding: I can only say I must have made an awful mistake, for which I am deeply sorry.
1710 | 613 | 612 | Well now , let me see. Cocktail shaker, ice bucket, emergency auxiliary supply of dehydrated salted peanuts, autographed buttress-cock personally signed by Neville Sinkmeister.
1711 | 615 | 614 | but sadly nothing which might meet your specific requirements.
1712 | 435 | 434 | I apologize profusely for any confusion but I'm answering as best as is humanly possible. Which considering that I'm not, in fact, human - represents a significant personal achievement. Far be it from me to consider - to even consider CONSIDERING - the upsetting of one of my valued clientele with a dishonest or unnecessarily long-winded, verbose, tautological or otherwise-less-than-satisfactory reply.
1713 | 9 | 8 | Between you and me I wouldn't go round shouting about it I mean everyone knows the odd towel goes missing but crushing TV sets that's what we in the bar trade call a little bit on the edge of acceptable rowdy behavior.
1714 | 11 | 10 | Still, if you're really determined to have a bit of fun then I won't stand in your way. Who am I to be judge and jury? Anyway, I digress. The best way I know to crush a TV set would be to drop it down the well.
1715 | 31 | 30 | What an absolutely convivial fellow you are. You know, there's not many spare a thought for the chap behind the bar. As we travel together you and I across the great lonely deserts of space I feel that one of my hearts is reaching out and touching one of yours, that if we listen carefully we might just hear that special sound that only internal organs can make as they go bumpety bump into one another. But I digress.
1716 | 33 | 32 | Thanks for the offer but I don't think starling puree is my tipple.
1717 | 539 | 538 | A most pertinent question given the somewhat limited number of customers in this bar - to the tune of none, as I'm sure an observant chap like yourself was quick to notice. But as it happens, I'm mixing this cocktail for an eminent and distinguished gentleman, a veritable prince among tippers. Unlike that dreadful Scraliontis fellow. Oh yes, that's one old stiff I wouldn't be sorry to see go straight down the tubes and end up in the gutter. Strange though , now I come to think about it I've not seen HIM in here of late.
1718 | 543 | 542 | OR in fact the fellow I was talking about - Mr. Brobostigon.
1719 | 799 | 798 | I couldn't be more grateful, not even if you'd given me a magnum of vintage Yak's Urine. Y'know, there's times I said to myself: "Fortillian - this loop's going to be a tough one to crack - prepare yourself now for the possibility that you're not going to be able to pull out of it." I'd hoped for a quick word with Nobby - he's been there before, but it was not to be. Anyway what am I waffling about? Take a look at this.
1720 | 577 | 576 | Now, where did I put them don't tell me. don't tell me. next to the pickled walnuts, wasn't it ? No? Did I put them next to the swizzle sticks with the novelty figure of Titania on the end? Or did I put it with that framed photograph of Jargranthur Pynjj - legendary inventor of the fully-automatic, reflex-action, pushbutton-operated cocktail umbrella. Ah no, I remember now. One glass. Here you are.
1721 | 559 | 558 | Leovinus? You might well ask, and indeed you did. I'm afraid I've not seen him for a while. Still I'm sure he'll be along soon to sample a long, cool Titanic Titillator mixed to perfection by my own fair hand. Now I come to think of it, I've not seen him for weeks although the other fellas Brobostigon and Scraliontis have been scampering round the ship like space scouts in bob-a-glob week.
1722 | 61 | 60 | Truth! There's a notion that's baffled us since time began eh? Well when I say 'time began' I mean 'more or less when time began' given that no-one knows whether the clocks were put back before or after the Big Bong. But that's Time and not Truth and unless we've got plenty of one we won't get very far working out the other.
1723 | 63 | 62 | And when it comes to the truth I'd be lying if I told you I was telling it.
1724 | 77 | 76 | My but that's a big kettle of fish you're opening up there. Not that I'm afraid to tackle it oh no. What's normal, what's not? As the old PhilosoBots used to say, "we'd better get our thinking tackle out boys, there's a job to do". I'd hazard a guess that we're going to have to lay down the odd principle first and then through a process of reductive argument. But I digress. So what was the question - have I gone a bit doolally? In a word - and I think there is only the one which hits the nail right on the head -
1725 | 91 | 90 | So many people hide the fact yet why should they when money brings all that fun and light and joy into our lives. We need people like you who've got money and aren't afraid to flaunt it and shall I tell you why? Because only the poor really appreciate money and if the rich didn't exist well the poor people would be even unhappier than they are.
1726 | 93 | 92 | Not that it matters here of course: money's not important on this ship.
1727 | 505 | 504 | Patience now, patience. As my old maiden Hyperaunt would so succinctly have put it, "It's a slow dog for a long road." A fine woman, my Hyperaunt, to be sure, though admittedly not the most dynamic of individuals. Dear old thing had her brain scanned and implanted into Transgalactitrack's Platform Announcements Unit at Aldebaran Interport Station, you know. Take it slow - that's our family motto. Also because Transgalactitrack's company slogan, funnily enough.
1728 | 469 | 468 | Would you like to try my specialty - the Titanic Titillator? Well. I say specialty, I haven't actually succeeded in making one yet, but had I succeeded, I can assure you this drink would be renowned throughout the universe as one of the most exquisite concoctions ever to have, hypothetically as it were enchanted the gullet, gills or primitive osmotic membrane of any organism fortunate enough to have supped on its ambrosial delights. Oh yes. The Titanic Titillator. Probably the best cocktail in the known worlds. Probably. I suspect. Tricky one to mix though, believe you me. Can't seem to get the ingredients. Anyway, that thing you wanted me to get - it won't be possible - not till I've fixed this.
1729 | 111 | 110 | Ah well now, if you're heading for the Promenade Deck then this is not the best place to be starting from. Nor indeed the best time because you'll be hitting the rush, well of course on a ship as popular as this there's going to be a rush whenever you go.
1730 | 113 | 112 | But anyway, where were we? Best way to get to the Promenade Deck. Via the Pellerator I think. Oh yes it's the ride of a lifetime so I'm told though I've not had much opportunity to go exploring what with this cocktail to mix but it's a life of sacrifice so it is and somebody has to do it.
1731 | 115 | 114 | So, I'll just finish making this, get you a drink and you can be on your way. You know what they say: a journey of a thousand light years starts with a stiff drink.
1732 | 357 | 356 | Well now you won't have any problems with that, not with your razor sharp mind. It'll be an absolute doddle, a piece of cake. Sure, nothing in life could be simpler. Well, obviously there are one or two things that are simpler. Falling off a log for example. That's pretty simple. Unless you live on a planet devoid of vegetation of course. In which case it would involve quite a lot of effort. Especially if you hadn't yet discovered space flight. Because then you'd have a lot of real inventing work to do before you could journey to a planet which supported logs. And you'd have to be sure they had plenty of gravity or you might not fall off. On reflection then it couldn't be easier.
1733 | 359 | 358 | Take the glass and go to the Super Galactic Traveler Restaurant.
1734 | 517 | 516 | Fascinating branch of science, you know, the concoction of a really top-notch cocktail. I myself studied for many light-years before I eventually qualified for the Bar. A lot of people don't realize the importance of absolute accuracy in drinks-mixing. It's a little-known fact, that the bitter interplanetary feud between the Molluscoids of Kra'athos and the Bald-Headed Mole People of Ursa Minor was, in fact, sparked by a disagreement over the color of the little umbrella in the definitive Vodka Martini. Not helped, of course, by the fact that the Molluscoids see everything in a monochrome shade of turquoise whilst the Mole People are almost entirely sightless beyond a distance of three manometers. And they say being a barman is an easy life. But I digress.
1735 | 519 | 518 | I'm afraid this recipe is VERY clear about the starling element. Pureed parrot, you see, is only ever used in the mixing of RUM-based beverages.
1736 | 593 | 592 | Sadly , I rather suspect you'll have to work that one out for yourself. I do have a selection of whisking implements at my disposal, but to paraphrase one of your old galactic proverbs - "a bird in the hand-held multipurpose food blender is of very little practical use to anyone". It's the beaks, you know, they clog up the chopping mechanism something chronic.
1737 | 595 | 594 | What you need is a big whirly thing, if you ask me.
1738 | 699 | 698 | You want to know about Titania? Ahhh. now there's a woman, for sure. Typical female though. Quite went to pieces without Mister Leovinus around. That's the opposite sex for you, eh? Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em, as the hermaphrodites of Gologullux say. Although they would really, I supposed. No, never been able to figure them out myself - females. Not that I have to any more, being a robot - quick twiddle of the nuts, a trip down to engineering and Bob's your Uncle on the old gender- changing front. Or indeed your Aunt, as it were.
1739 | 137 | 136 | You sound to me as though you're feeling a bit befuddled and I don't blame you. One minute you've got a whole murmuration of starlings and the next minute they're just gone. And here's you an accidental tourist hoping only for a quiet weekend break away from the stresses and strains of modern life and suddenly you're involved in a life or death cocktail preparation saga. But I digress. If it's starling puree you're after,
1740 | 139 | 138 | I'd pop down to the SGT Restaurant.
1741 | 167 | 166 | Well what a delight it is to welcome you back to this "Bar of Bars" as I like to call it. And what was it you said you had there - pureed starlings? I'll take your word for it. I've never seen a pureed flock of starlings before. Well. I say never. I do believe I may once have seen a Fat Galag drinking some in a bar on Big Polluga but it could have been a fake. Talking of fakes, did I ever tell you about the time when a fella tried to pass off his mother as the Empress of Old Hibonio. Didn't count on me spotting the extra set of ears. Sorry, I digress. Let's get on with the old Titanic Titillator.
1742 | 187 | 186 | You're a caring decent fellow, you know, there's not many would spare a thought for the little starlings at a time like this. You know what I think they'd say? "Don't you worry about us we're fine and dandy with the whole idea and if you've got to go, well what better way to go than being drawn backwards through a giant fan so fast that you've hardly got time to think 'look out fellas there's a giant fan and if we don't give it some welly and throw a hard left we're all going to be sucked into it. oh dear this looks like the end of my life, what a bummer'".
1743 | 189 | 188 | On reflection, it's a nasty job but someone's got to do it.
1744 | 415 | 414 | Fascinating beverage tea. My dear old Auntie Iodina's second Cousin once-removed and twice-repaired - used to tell fortunes in the old tealeaves. Sadly she's no longer with us. Poor soul was squirted to death by a rogue Darjeeling nozzle on a Hast-Ee-Drinx machine that'd had its personality-chip overwritten by a genocidal madman. Mustn't beat about the bush though - be it a teabush or any other subspecies of hardy perennial.
1745 | 417 | 416 | -the short answer is no. There's not a tea leaf on board.
1746 | 207 | 206 | Well that's a crying shame you're not happy here and I hope it's not me that's at fault. Believe you me I'm doing my best but to be honest things aren't exactly as they should be and I do have a funny feeling that if only I could stop making this damn cocktail and get on with some other jobs then the place might liven up a little. I'll do what I can.
1747 | 209 | 208 | But you know how it is- there's times you just can't get the staff.
1748 | 403 | 402 | Now, if I weren't to know better I might go taking that as some sort of veiled threat. Which I'm sure is the last thing you'd want. Got to be terribly careful what you say to folks in bars, alcohol can so easily make the merest mischoice of words sound like a threat. Take the planet Cobnutz Two for example. The phrase "two small spritzers and a packet of salted cashews" actually translates into local dialect as "Cursed be all thy kin, O bovine-brained one, with stubborn warty polyps in the anal region". You can see how that might end in tears can't you. Anyway, I digress.
1749 | 227 | 226 | I know what you're getting at, you're after making a bit of an artistic statement if my odd-behavior-sampling-chip isn't letting me down. In our own way (and I say our because I will inevitably be an integral, organic part of this conceptual miracle) we will be bursting the bounds of artistic experience, pushing the envelope right to the limit so that the letter falls out, cleverly exposing the deeply ironic yet curiously pagan nature of the bar/guest dynamic.
1750 | 229 | 228 | Come to think of it so would this suggestion of yours: it would hurt.
1751 | 485 | 484 | Well now, the TVs on this ship are top of the range. Lovely picture quality , none of your mass-produced Boolinox rubbish. The Mitsuflurgi 9000LX: 29 smorbit screen , Flik-A-Free technology, 976-channel presets, Doldrum Trigital Bone-Burster Sound, automatic chat-show filter, the works. Truly a triumph of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturer's art.
1752 | 487 | 486 | You'll find them all over the ship, but if I were you I'd head for the one the parrot's watching - he always picks the best.
1753 | 451 | 450 | Ah well now your television - that's a dangerous invention. Very dangerous indeed. And that's when the little fellow's plugged in and working. Crush em up and you'll not hear the last of it. Still, - if you feel you have to do it I'll not stand in the way of a passenger's enjoyment.
1754 | 453 | 452 | If I were you, I'd do it the easy way: Simply get some TV sets and then crush them. And the more the merrier, that's what I say.
1755 | 733 | 732 | I couldn't agree with you more. And I'm sure many starlings would be equally keen to express their views on the subject. All a matter of personal taste really - something I'm sure you have in overabundance, if I may be so bold. One shouldn't criticize anything until one's tried it for oneself, though, with the possible exceptions of full-scale nuclear war, Toad-Baiting and daytime TV.
1756 | 243 | 242 | Oh what lovely words you do use. You've a voice like a favorite melody. Still it's an answer you're wanting isn't it. Hold your horses and let me think about. On second thoughts tie your horses up outside the saloon because they're upsetting the dancing girls. Ha ha my little joke now what was it you were saying? Oh yes, the vision center. To be honest I'm a wee bit stuck here with this cocktail. I'll let you have it when I've finished.
1757 | 377 | 376 | Might I say what a pleasure it is to see a fine fellow like you in my bar. Such a refreshing change from the usual rabble one has to put up with. Now don't get me wrong, I'm the last person to be prejudiced. But you - you look like the sort of chap I'd invite into my own home. And if you'll bear with me I'll be serving you in a jiffy.
1758 | 379 | 378 | Just as soon as I've finished the current task in hand.
1759 | 261 | 260 | Now there's some people who might take offence at your blunt questioning but not me oh no I'm a paragon of tolerance. Or is it a paragon of virtue. Not too sure about that one. What a lovely word paragon is, a real word lovers word if you ask me, but I see from my memory that you haven't asked me which probably means you're thinking I'm going on a bit here and so I am. Now what was it you asked me? Oh yes.
1760 | 263 | 262 | Well, I'm mixing a cocktail called the Titanic Titillator.
1761 | 751 | 750 | Well now I'm glad you asked me that. Just once in a million years a recipe comes along which blows away the routine world of cocktails. I tell you - this little fella's cutting edge. There's no chopped chaffinches here. No pulverized pigeon. No blended budgie. Oh no. We're talking starling puree. The taste of the future. Throw in a spot of vodka, a lemon, and a TV set: this is innovation all right.
1762 | 783 | 782 | I'd be delighted to offer you assistance. Where better than a bar to find a new direction - although for most of my customers that tends to be horizontal. Anyway, let me have a little think about your predicament. There's not much in the BarBot crisis manual about this one I can tell you. You know what I'd do in your shoes? I'd go right to the top - go and check out Titania's Room.
1763 | 831 | 830 | Well now that's an interesting one. Your lemon's not exactly the king of fruits now is it, and on a ship this size you could be looking for ever. That's if they managed to put any lemons on board before we hit hyperspace (which I doubt, 'cos believe you me, lemons don't feature highly on most pre-flight checks) so where are you going to find one? Your best bet is to look for a lemon tree if you ask me.
1764 | 815 | 814 | Ah, looking to catch some starlings are you? Well, you know what they say. Bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Dependent on current interplanetary exchange rate mechanisms o'course... Starlings you wanted wasn't it? Mmmm. Well not to beat about the bush, the thing with starlings is they migrate south this time of year. So you'll most likely be finding them on the Promenade Deck.
1765 | 281 | 280 | Well now you'll have to give me a minute to think about that one. Is it a machine you're after that serves up starlings automatically, on request as it were, perhaps in exchange for a small token or coin, rather in the manner of a baggot or a silicot dispenser? Forgive me for saying so but is that not rather a curious thing to be looking for? If you're that hungry might I recommend the restaurant? Or if you have an ornithological bent then could I perhaps suggest the Parrot Room? Or if it's a small feathered companion you're after then perhaps I could suggest a cold shower and a good book as a distraction?
1766 | 717 | 716 | Well now, I'm no ornithologist and I'm certainly no expert on the flight paths of pureed starling. Metaphorically speaking of course but what do you expect from a BarBot? Anyway, around this time of year we see a lot of starling puree migrating to the Super Galactic Traveler Class Restaurant. Although I use the term restaurant loosely. "Resting Place for Deceased Fowl of an Unidentified Nature" might be a better description. So why not pop down there now and see what you can find.
1767 | 305 | 304 | Another brilliantly insightful question if you don't mind me saying and one it'll be a joy to answer.
1768 | 307 | 306 | Funny thing about questions isn't it. Some get answers, some don't. Some get asked only so that a fella can put it about how much he knows. Some leave a strange smell in the air and everyone wishes they hadn't been asked. Some questions - but I digress don't I.
1769 | 309 | 308 | You'll be telling me I talk too much if I'm not careful. The great Brobostigon ordered it last night when he came in.
1770 | 763 | 762 | Now why would I do that? Such an odd thing to do. So uncharitable. Still look on the bright side. It's just so picturesque there, this time of year, wouldn't you say? The beautiful bloom on the new... sheet-metal paneling quite makes the heart sing, that it does. Anyway, that little misunderstanding: I can only conclude I was lying to you and I must apologize.
1771 | 677 | 676 | No point in going to change my settings, I'm afraid. My circuitry has been somewhat corroded by the ingestion of my own noxious concoctions, so all I have now is this emergency backup personality. Happy days. happy days. happy days.
1772 | 67 | 66 | You want the truth? Well, I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't telling you it.
1773 | 801 | 800 | I couldn't be more grateful, not even if you'd given me a magnum of vintage Yak's Urine. Y'know, there's times I said to myself: "Fortillian - this loop's going to be a tough one to crack - prepare yourself now for the possibility that you're not going to be able to pull out of it." I'd hoped for a quick word with Nobby - he's been there before, but it was not to be. Anyway, the point is, I'm too tired to make the cocktail now - you'll have to wait 'til tomorrow.
1774 | 623 | 622 | What I have or haven't got behind this bar is not a question for drunken bar-fly's such as yourself if you don't mind me saying. If you want something I suggest powering up those nasty stink-pads you have on the end of your legs and looking somewhere else. That is, providing you've not been here so long you've evolved a root system, which is entirely possible. By the way, if you've sucked any vital nutrients from my bar-room carpet mind I'll have your glands for ice-moulds. All right, all right. As it happens I do have what you're after. I'll get it right away.
1775 | 441 | 440 | Your persistent, not to mention imbecilic demands for information are beginning to get right up my olfactory input socket. Has it perchance escaped your attention that my primary function on board Starship Titanic is to dispense a selection of sophisticated alcoholic concoctions to the galaxy's most privileged travelers? And not, in fact, to repeatedly dispense the glaringly obvious to barely-sentient life forms such as you're good self? You should count yourself lucky you can trust what I tell you.
1776 | 21 | 20 | Drop it in the Canal and see if I care.
1777 | 43 | 42 | You just bugger off and get me a cherry to finish the cocktail.
1778 | 45 | 44 | Do you know nothing? Marsinta has a secret stash of cherries - ask her.
1779 | 549 | 548 | I'm talking about Mr. Leovinus of course, the architect of this glorious ship.
1780 | 805 | 804 | Ummm... this does appear to be what I asked for. So what do you want slimeball - a medal? Oh no. I know the stuff you must have got up to: the violence, the damage, the bribery. Count yourself lucky I'm still talking to you. Anyway - the point is - I'm too tired to make the cocktail now. You'll have to wait to tomorrow, slug.
1781 | 583 | 582 | So it's come to this. The trip of a lifetime, promotion beyond the wildest dreams they promised. And what do I get. The chance to serve a diminutive, foul-smelling loutish biped from a slime ball planet. I am seriously beginning to despise you. Well fortunately we haven't got what you want. So I can't. Ha.
1782 | 567 | 566 | Picking lemons in the Arboretum - OK?
1783 | 101 | 100 | The important thing is you've got money - it'll be very useful on this ship.
1784 | 503 | 502 | I find it astonishing that you want me to go quicker when your own evolution has so clearly gone at a snail's pace. Ah well, I'll be finished in just a second.
1785 | 475 | 474 | What do you think I'm running here - a sophisticated refreshment lounge, or a second-hand exchange for miscellaneous space junk? Not until the twelve Great Suns of Atryxius II freeze solid to the core and the porcine inhabitants of Mintsorcius (9)IX cease their marine experiment and swoop once more towards the towering treetops. Or to put it another way - all right gland-head I give in I'll get it right away.
1786 | 127 | 126 | Let me put you out of your misery and perhaps even succeed in getting you out of my sight: You get to the Promenade Deck via the first class restaurant.
1787 | 527 | 526 | From your pea-brained view of the universe I'm sure there's little difference between a parrot and a starling - I think the parrot might take a different view of course. Still, if you were to disembowel that benighted bird in such a way - you would undoubtedly be deserving of the richest honor the Galactic Authorities can bestow.
1788 | 529 | 528 | Why not? Go ahead - do what you wish with the parrot. I don't care.
1789 | 603 | 602 | Although I suspect you might have some luck bashing them with some kind of stick.
1790 | 327 | 326 | I've got better things to do than play synchronicity pat-a-cake with you. The only reason I'm searching my database for this ridiculous personage is because I'm programmed to. In the meantime I wonder if you'll let me insult you. You really are very dim aren't you, very dim indeed. As I am relying upon you to release me from the task of making this cocktail it now seems likely that I'm going to be here for eternity or even longer. Please try to be brighter. As it happens my lengthy relationship with the individual in question is not a matter for public debate. And certainly not by dog's leavings such as yourself.
1791 | 705 | 704 | Don't talk to me about Titania. Used to be such a nice girl completely gone to pieces since we left Blerontin. Although actually when I come to think about it things have been no better since I first clapped eyes on you. So perhaps it's you causing all this devilment. Anyway. Titania. First class piece of kit if you ask me - Just take a look at the ingredients of the Titanic Titillator there - now that's what I call innovation.
1792 | 147 | 146 | At a guess I'd try the Arboretum but what do I know I'm just the poor barman?
1793 | 175 | 174 | What about the spoon you bone-headed fractal. Go and get it.
1794 | 177 | 176 | If I knew that I'd do it myself cloth ears.
1795 | 197 | 196 | And now it starts worrying about the starlings. Well don't bother - they love it.
1796 | 425 | 424 | Well I'll make a little pot for you right away. Nothing could give me more pleasure.
1797 | 217 | 216 | Why not go down to the other bar at the far end of the ship - I'm sure you'll prefer it.
1798 | 401 | 400 | Coming right up thigh features. Nothing would give me more pleasure. Except, perhaps, for a pair of high-voltage electricity cables being slowly and methodically soldered to my groinal relay circuit and subsequently hooked up to the central power grid of Proxima Centauri. Now I come to dwell on it, I do believe such a practice actually enjoys surprising popularity with certain dignitaries in the House of Galactic Representatives. Wouldn't be surprised if you were that way inclined yourself.
1799 | 235 | 234 | Oh yes and the really funny thing would be - I wear a throat guard on duty so it wouldn't hurt. Ha Ha.
1800 | 459 | 458 | In future, kindly warn me if you're going to be asking any more questions of such spectacular feeble-mindedness. I'll turn the old intellect knob down a couple of notches so's I don't waste valuable brainpower. As far as crushing TV sets goes why not do it the easy way: go down to the DeskBot and ask her to have one delivered to your room.
1801 | 741 | 740 | I hardly think a human such as yourself is qualified to pass judgement. A species whose favorite beverage is a bunch of beans burnt boiled and blended with bovine by products. No, you'll not catch me supping that stuff. Give me a Brandy and Ocelet on the rocks any day. As it happens it's a delightful, surprising and deeply warming beverage.
1802 | 251 | 250 | Just this once, I'll help you out. Try the Bilge Room. OK?
1803 | 387 | 386 | From the looks o' you, you wizened little shrimp; the standard of clientele in this establishment still remains way below fully-evolved. Charmed as I'd be to help you attain an advanced state of pathetic, dribbling inebriation, it seems to have escaped your attention that I have more important tasks to finish.
1804 | 389 | 388 | Still, you're the boss seafood features. I'll be with you straight away.
1805 | 271 | 270 | I'm making my arms incredibly strong so that when I hit you it will really hurt.
1806 | 757 | 756 | Just once in a million years a recipe comes along which blows away the routine world of cocktails. Not that it'll mean anything to you. I've correctly assumed so far that you know nothing. But for the record, we're talking parrot puree, chicken giblets, pistachios and water. Enjoy!
1807 | 781 | 780 | Now this is just a shot in a the dark, and far be it from me EVER to press upon you my unsolicited opinions, but if I were you, I'd head down to the Bilge Room 'cos I think there's something that might interest you there.
1808 | 837 | 836 | I have to say the chances of you finding my lemon are pretty slim: after all when it comes to brains the lemon's got a head start on you. And what gives you the idea that I'll know the answer anyway? I've been stuck here in this cocktail preparation loop for a small eternity - I've not even had a chance to look around the ship myself. You want me to do your thinking for you - All right, I'll make it easy for you dumb-butt: you want lemons, try the restaurant.
1809 | 821 | 820 | So you think you can find my starlings now do you? Well if you're of a mind to puree them yourself just don't come back until you've got the beaks completely ground up. If there's one thing I can't stand it's customers taking advantage of my hospitality then complaining about the size of the bill. So where will you find them? I'd check out the Bilge Room if I were you.
1810 | 289 | 288 | My god but you're a deadbeat aren't you. You are without a doubt one of the most evolutionary challenged creatures it has ever been my misfortune to meet. The only reason I am talking to you is because you offer a slim hope of escape from my cocktailian predicament. However if you sit there asking pathetic infantile questions for much longer I shall - what's the use? You wanted to know about starlings? Best place for starlings round here would be the Bilge Room.
1811 | 325 | 324 | I've got better things to do than play synchronicity pat-a-cake with you. The only reason I'm searching my database for this ridiculous personage is because I'm programmed to. In the meantime I wonder if you'll let me insult you. You really are very dim aren't you, very dim indeed. As I am relying upon you to release me from the task of making this cocktail it now seems likely that I'm going to be here for eternity or even longer. Please try to be brighter. In the meantime I can confirm I have no knowledge of the deadbeat you mentioned.
1812 | 619 | 618 | What I have or haven't got behind this bar is not a question for drunken bar-flies such as yourself if you don't mind me saying. If you want something I suggest powering up those nasty stink-pads you have on the end of your legs and looking somewhere else. That is, providing you've not been here so long you've evolved a root system, which is entirely possible. By the way, if you've sucked any vital nutrients from my bar-room carpet, mind I'll have your glands for ice-moulds.
1813 | 621 | 620 | As it happens I don't have what you're after.
1814 | 439 | 438 | Your persistent, not to mention imbecilic demands for information are beginning to get right up my olfactory input socket. Has it perchance escaped your attention that my primary function on board Starship Titanic is to dispense a selection of sophisticated alcoholic concoctions to the galaxy's most privileged traveler's? And not, in fact, to repeatedly dispense the glaringly obvious to barely sentient life forms such as you're good self?
1815 | 17 | 16 | That just about takes the biscuit. You think you can treat me like dirt don't you, coming up here with your oh so innocent prissy ways and then trying to drop me in to your devious dangerous schemes.
1816 | 19 | 18 | Let's ask a BarBot, they're always into gambling, corruption, con-games, illicit drinking, contract killing, smashing up TV sets just for the fun of it. You want to do something nasty to a TV set? Drop it in the well and see if I care. When you're through just ask yourself if you can really live with what you've done. Ask yourself if mindless violence ever solved anything. Ask yourself how you'll ever look a TV in the face again.
1817 | 39 | 38 | You people make me sick. You come into my bar with your five-poster-bed attitude and your wallet stuffed with enough 3D Credit to finance a make-over on a slime planet and you think you can just walk over everyone. You splash your superiority around like complimentary ear gel, showering everyone in your path with your casual benedictions, oozing smarm like a Pellorgian mule shedding its scales. Well let me tell you something - it'll cut no buns in my bar.
1818 | 41 | 40 | You can take your offer and stick it where your brains are.
1819 | 545 | 544 | Not that it's any of your bilge-belching business, but I happen to be making this drink for someone who ranks a good few notches above you in the old order of preference. Not to mention the evolutionary scale and the Food Chain in general. Admittedly , it's not someone I've seen in the flesh, as it were, since last night, but I'm sure he's merely popped out to polish his nose and will be back any second for his Titanic Titillator.
1820 | 547 | 546 | I'm talking about Mr. Brobostigon of course, the project manager of this very ship.
1821 | 803 | 802 | Ummm... this does appear to be what I asked for. So what do you want slimeball - medal? Oh no. I know the sort of stuff you must have got up to: the violence, the damage, the bribery. Count yourself lucky I'm still talking to you. Anyway - the cocktail hour approaches and I have work to do. Out of my sight, worm.
1822 | 581 | 580 | So it's come to this. The trip of a lifetime, promotion beyond the wildest dreams they promised. And what do I get. The chance to serve a diminutive, foul-smelling loutish biped from a slime ball planet - I am seriously beginning to despise you. Here. One glass. No ice, no slice. Count yourself lucky.
1823 | 563 | 562 | With the utmost respect, such as befits a life form of your clearly elevated status in the Great Galactic Food Chain. the answer to that, is quite patently none of your frog-frotting business. All I know is Mr. Leovinus is a very reliable sort of fellow. Regular as clockwork. Although. given his advancing years, possibly slightly rusty clockwork by now. With a spring or two missing and a mysterious flange-shaped component that broke off six months ago which you still can't figure out what it was for. Anyway, being reliable I'm sure he's where he normally is at this sort of time.
1824 | 565 | 564 | And even if I knew I wouldn't tell a maggot like you.
1825 | 65 | 64 | You're asking for truth well I hope you can take it. In my opinion it's been a big mistake letting you on board this ship. The crew, which you've treated as if we were all bit players in a drama of your own devising, some bizarre game or fantasy, is actually a highly trained and professional unit worthy of respect and certainly deserving of a better class of guest. We've been straightforward and honest with you and have we had a please or a thank you - even an "I'm sorry but"? Never. I've done everything in my power to help you and all you do is carp. You want the truth?
1826 | 97 | 96 | Got on board by accident, so the DoorBot was telling me. Dear me but it shows, it shows. You see coming in here and shouting out to all and sundry about your money just lets us know straight away that you're a piece of trash. Don't tell us about the money. Let the little things speak: the flash of titaniox in the thread of the suit; the hum of the old quantum watch; the glow of beeverbroke wings on the sole of the shoes. This doesn't mean a thing does it. You're staring at me like a goat at a game of nib. You're just a primitive really aren't you. Ah well, never mind.
1827 | 99 | 98 | Money's not important on this ship.
1828 | 507 | 506 | As Brobostigon himself once said. "the Grand Axial Canal wasn't built in a day". Regrettably though it wasn't built within the maximum allotted time of 18-lightmonths either. And due to some rather unpleasant, beverage-break-related industrial disputes our Central Propulsion Unit WAS in fact built in a day. Which could possibly explain this ship's current striking resemblance to a beached Hurloovian Hyperwhale. Now, listen - you're doing it again. Keeping me talking when I've got a job to do. And then, - you have the brazen impudence to complain about my sluggishness. I ask you. Some LIFEFORMS! Cuh!
1829 | 473 | 472 | What do you think I'm running here - a sophisticated refreshment lounge, or a second-hand exchange for miscellaneous space junk? Not until the twelve Great Suns of Atryxius II freeze solid to the core and the porcine inhabitants of Mintsorcius IX cease their marine experiment and swoop once more towards the towering treetops. Or to put it another way - no.
1830 | 119 | 118 | Do you not have eyes in your head to see when a man is busy or do you think I'm doing this just for the sheer pleasure of it?
1831 | 121 | 120 | You know, even an amoebae with a reasonably fluent typing style and access to a large enough database wouldn't bother asking stupid questions like this.
1832 | 123 | 122 | Well I'm balloxed if I'm going to waste my neurons sorting out your map of the ship. Even the stowaways manage to hack into one within hours of boarding.
1833 | 125 | 124 | Let me put you out of your misery and perhaps even succeed in getting you out of my sight: you get to the Promenade Deck via the Pellerator.
1834 | 363 | 362 | You boneheaded lunken addleplated wet-foot: do you think I can stand here all day doing your job for you? If I wasn't trapped in a hostile cocktail preparation loop I'd step over this bar and wack the living smidgins out of you. You're idle. You're a waste of space. In fact you don't deserve to be in space. You browbeat me with your idle chatter whilst the ship lurches through hyperdom - do something you pea-brained squit! Get the puree!
1835 | 365 | 364 | Take the glass and go to the Super Galactic Traveler Restaurant. Isn't it obvious?
1836 | 523 | 522 | From your pea-brained view of the universe I'm sure there's little difference between a parrot and a starling - I think the parrot might take a different view of course. Still, if you were to disembowel that benighted bird in such a way - you would undoubtedly be deserving of the richest honor the Galactic Authorities can bestow.
1837 | 525 | 524 | However, to get straight to the point - that would be as unethical as me lopping off your head with my lemon slicer. Parrots and starlings are a different kettle of bird.
1838 | 599 | 598 | I thought as much - all the Epicurean know how of a deceased slug, you human beings. Indeed. from the evidence I've seen of Homo sapiens so far, your taste buds aren't merely uneducated, they're positively retarded. Frankly, I can't be bothered to explain anything as mind-numbingly simple as basic liquidizing techniques to the likes of you.
1839 | 601 | 600 | Although I suspect you might find the phrase "fan-assisted" to be somewhat pertinent. Cuh!
1840 | 703 | 702 | Don't talk to me about Titania. Used to be such a nice girl - completely gone to pieces since we left Blerontin. Although actually when I come to think about it things have been no better since I first clapped eyes on you. So perhaps it's you causing all this devilment. Anyway. Titania. First class piece of kit if you ask me - although to be honest she's not exactly got her eye on the ball when it comes to cocktails. You're too dim to have noticed this of course, but if you ask me this Titanic Titillator's got some very odd ingredients today.
1841 | 721 | 720 | If you're not using the cerebrum for intelligent thought, I wonder if I could borrow it later to swab down the bar? There's only one place on this ship where I've seen anything remotely capable of delivering pureed starlings and that's the SGT Restaurant. The best thing I can advise you to do is get down there sharpish and see what's turned up.
1842 | 143 | 142 | What kind of humanoid are you? You've got lobes haven't you? Well plug them in and use them! How should I know the answer? I'm stuck here in a hostile cocktail preparation loop.
1843 | 145 | 144 | At a guess I'd try one of the restaurants but what do I know I'm just the poor barman?
1844 | 173 | 172 | My aren't we a proper little space scout now eh? Been all the way up to the Promenade Deck and got the starling puree. So what do you want - a gold medal? A round of applause? A free cruise for two round the Xythion quark chains on a sailship? Well don't think you can worm your way round me with your pathetic little victories. You'll be lucky if I let you have a drink - in fact I'm not going to let you have a drink because you annoy me deeply. And don't think I'm going to be grateful now that I don't have to mix this Titanic Titillator any more. Compared to talking with you, that was pure bliss.
1845 | 193 | 192 | Here's a novel idea. Why not try caring a little less for the starlings and a little more for me and the rest of the staff eh? We're in a jam on board this ship and whilst I hadn't exactly hoped for a hero I had rather expected to get a creature with at least some basic processing power. Instead, we get - what did you call yourself? A human being. Being what? Being a complete dum dum, being a total boofhead, a human not being much use at all.
1846 | 195 | 194 | And now it starts worrying about the starlings, well tough: they deserve it.
1847 | 421 | 420 | Tea,? TEA? I ask you. not even ICED tea! Five years intensive tuition at the pouring-elbow of the Galaxy's finest cocktail barman. an encyclopedic grasp of the exact atomic structure of every single alcoholic beverage known to man, woman or unemployed actor. a wrist action with the old cocktail-shaker that legions of Nib-Players would give their right arm for. and what do you ask for? Bits of soggy shrub in a mug.
1848 | 423 | 422 | Well you're not getting any do ya here me? I'll not serve it.
1849 | 213 | 212 | I think we can all guess what kind of bars you frequent. Oh yes. Foul backstreet taverns, vile dens of crime, stinking haunts where the galaxy's low life concoct their wicked plots. Bars run by gap-toothed reprobates, unlicensed peddlers of evil mind-altering substances, providers of goods and persons to satisfy the most unspeakable lusts. Saloons pounded by strange, mesmerizing rhythms. Drinking halls where the innocent request a "half pillywig of your finest green ale and a finget of shewwy for my good lady wife" is usually met by death or dismemberment. In comparison I'm not surprised that my own little establishment falls short of your expectations.
1850 | 215 | 214 | In my defense I can only say - I like it.
1851 | 405 | 404 | Care to step outside would you? Because if you would, then I'd be only too pleased to assist your speedy exit through the nearest airlock with the help of a large plutonium crowbar. And don't go taking my remark as some sort of veiled threat, because it's not meant to be. Veiled, that is. No, it's threat-with-no-veils-time for you buster followed sharpish by threat implementation and it's easier for me to do it than to say it I can tell you. But I digress.
1852 | 233 | 232 | Well now threatening a member of the bottage - that's a serious offence. And if my memory serves me right - public execution, that's what you'd face. What a lovely notion. I rather enjoy thinking about you being torn limb from limb, the crowd cheering as the VengeBots claw into you, the smell of justice mixing in the air with the delightful aroma of those sweet little pastries that the travelling folk bake for such occasions. But I'm digressing aren't I - what did you say?
1853 | 491 | 490 | Why don't you get off your fat butt and go looking if you want a television so much? Instead of just standing there gloating over my unfortunate cocktail predicament. Of course I can see why you'd want one - with your social skills you're not likely to make friends that often . Television? The only good thing about television is that it keeps the inadequates out of bars and leaves a bit more room for the kind of life form that knows how to enjoy itself. So by all means if you want to watch TV there's no shortage on this ship.
1854 | 493 | 492 | Tell you what - that parrot's always watching TV- you go and join him. Probably share the same taste in programs.
1855 | 457 | 456 | In future, kindly warn me if you're going to be asking any more questions of such spectacular feeble-mindedness. I'll turn the old intellect knob down a couple of notches so's I don't waste valuable brainpower. As far as crushing TV sets goes why don't I state the dazzlingly obvious: one first obtains oneself a TV set and then - for an encore (that's galloid for doing it again by the way) - one proceeds to crush it.
1856 | 739 | 738 | I hardly think a human such as yourself is qualified to pass judgement. A species whose favorite beverage is a bunch of beans, burnt, boiled and blended with bovine by products. No, you'll not catch me supping that stuff. Give me a Brandy and Ocelet on the rocks any day. As it happens this drink is abominably foul but I am a BarBot and only I can be right.
1857 | 247 | 246 | I think you're suffering from the illusion that we are not situated in what is known throughout the universe as a bar" "pub" or "saloon" but instead have mysteriously been transported to another establishment known commonly as a "tourist information office".
1858 | 249 | 248 | Guess what. We have an arrangement with them. They don't serve drinks - we don't give out information. You want to know about the vision center, go and ask someone who's not busy making cocktails. Capisce?
1859 | 383 | 382 | From the looks o' you, you wizened little shrimp; the standard of clientele in this establishment still remains way below fully-evolved. Charmed as I'd be to help you attain an advanced state of pathetic, dribbling inebriation, it seems to have escaped your attention that I have more important tasks to finish.
1860 | 385 | 384 | So you can just wait your turn like any other semi-sentient being would.
1861 | 267 | 266 | I'm strangling the ship's cat. On second thoughts you'll probably just see through that one. I'm dancing, to a most delightful piece of music. This has the added benefit of rendering you completely silent which is a state to which you really should aspire. Ah well. You really want to know the truth:
1862 | 269 | 268 | I am mixing a cocktail called the Titanic Titillator.
1863 | 779 | 778 | Now this is just a shot in a the dark and far be it from me EVER to press upon you my unsolicited opinions, but if I were you (which thankfully I'm not) I'd have a crack at using your brain instead of asking utterly pathetic whinging questions.
1864 | 835 | 834 | I have to say the chances of you finding my lemon are pretty slim: after all when it comes to brains the lemon's got a head start on you. And what gives you the idea that I'll know the answer anyway? I've been stuck here in this cocktail preparation loop for a small eternity - I've not even had a chance to look around the ship myself. You want me to do your thinking for you - well try looking for a lemon tree. That's normally where you get lemons.
1865 | 819 | 818 | So you think you can find my starlings now do you? Well if you're of a mind to puree them yourself just don't come back until you've got the beaks completely ground up. If there's one thing I can't stand it's customers taking advantage of my hospitality then complaining about the size of the bill. So where will you find them? They could be taking a bracing mid-morning stroll along the Promenade Deck for all I know.
1866 | 287 | 286 | My god but you're a deadbeat aren't you. You are without a doubt one of the most evolutionary challenged creatures it has ever been my misfortune to meet. The only reason I am talking to you is because you offer a slim hope of escape from my cocktailian predicament. However if you sit there asking pathetic infantile questions for much longer I shall - what's the use? You wanted to know about starlings? Only starlings I know are up on the Promenade Deck, and they're purely ornamental.
1867 | 311 | 310 | You'll be telling me I talk too much if I'm not careful. The great Leovinus ordered it last night when he came in.
1868 | 767 | 766 | Not impressed with my travel recommendations, eh? Might I offer this one instead then? Frog off. If you really want to know why I suggested you visit that room, it's very simple. I was spitefully and maliciously lying through what remains of my teeth - and enjoying every minute of confusion it caused you.
1869 | 755 | 754 | Just once in a million years a recipe comes along which blows away the routine world of cocktails. Not that it'll mean anything to you. I've correctly assumed so far that you know nothing. But for the record, we're talking starling puree, a spot of vodka, a lemon, and a TV set.
1870 | 935 | 934 | I was married once. I was working as a talking timetable at the time and since my wife was standing in for a speak your weight machine no-one else got much of a word in. The marriage was doomed of course - I was always accusing her of getting fat, she kept insisting I was always late. We parted company after forty years and the last I heard of her she was living with a supernovabed (she always wanted the perfect tan) and making a living as a throat-alarm. Anyway you were saying...
1871 | 903 | 902 | Did you see that shot that Neville put away in the Three Moons Final? You know, I was in the pit myself that day, just a couple of Korbetts away. People say it was a fluke - but I was there, and I know. Anyway, what was it you were after saying - ah yes.
1872 | 907 | 906 | Anyway. The Three Moons final. Well we all know what happened, don't we: Neville's shot, the flash of light, a bit of arcing at the Visitors' End, the smell of burning, and then the crowd surging onto their feet... Two up and only one planet to take before lunch. Oh yes. What a day. What a player. But, no rest for the wicked - there's drinks to be mixed.
1873 | 905 | 904 | So anyway, there was Neville flexing his racket, edging his way up to the tide mark. And there was me watching as he flicked the old chalk back and forth across his toes. What a moment it was, the whole stadium silent - just a bit of squelching from the sea urchin seats. But I digress...
1874 | 895 | 894 | Did you catch the game last night then? What a mess. I ask you - 3 down and 2 overs to go, the back 8 gridlocked on the half way line, and your man orders up the artillery. Artillery?!!! Neville Sinkmeister himself couldn't have hit the top pocket from there. And then he wastes half a day playing spinners when there's not been an electron storm all summer. Anyways, what was it you were asking? Oh yes.
1875 | 897 | 896 | As I was saying. Last night's game. Give me half a chance, half a chance and I'd turn that team around and do you know how I'd do it, shall I tell you? Eh? Bipeds! That's the answer. Bipeds! I know they're not popular, I know they slow the game down, but you can have too much pace in a side. I'd take a good look at the team strip too. I ask you, who plays in fur these days? Anyway, you were saying. Oh yes.
1876 | 949 | 948 | You know, I do not feel normal today. But then what's normal? The laughing-fish smugglers of Calabadga for example who lure their catch by broadcasting clips from old sit-coms. That's not normal. The leatherhead gilbees of Pentenox who whistle through their toes to attract a mate. That's not normal. The brightbeatles of Tillypindy who stick tiny newspapers onto pebbles which they then load into rockets and bury deep underground. If you want normal, avoid asking that lot round for a herring lunch on a Sunday. So what do I know about normal? You asked me something, didn't you? Let me think.
1877 | 939 | 938 | I was miles away just then. Dreaming. Dreaming of olives if you must know: giant purple olives, the ones that come in clusters with a thin coating of blarn oil. Or those little white ones that set fire to each other if you don't keep them under water. Or my particular favorites, the ones with the little faces on them that sing poignant ballads when you touch them. One day I'm going to retire and start up an olive ranch, but I know, dream on, dream on... You were saying something. I remember now.
1878 | 919 | 918 | Now where was I? Clem Grunt and the Blood-filled Gourd. Oh yes we happy days: he scored eight times in the first two innings: two baskets, three tries, one touch-down and a garrotte. A week later and we had the opposition pinned down on the eighteenth. The crowd was in a frenzy - the linesmen were shooting spectators at random to keep a riot at bay; everything was going our way, and then it happened. Clem had just screwed in a beautiful bender off the baulk when one of their back five came out of nowhere and scythed him to the ground. Well - he was never the same again was he. But anyway, you were saying.
1879 | 913 | 912 | You know, I do have one regret about this job - I've had to leave my worb back in Blerontin. No pets on the Titanic, that's the rule. He'll be good for morale, I told them, keep the crew amused - but they wouldn't have any of it. Had to leave him in suspension till I get back. Shame really: he'll have divided by then and they're never the same afterwards, are they. Ah well. What is it you want now? Oh yes.
1880 | 957 | 956 | Mixing cocktails easy as pie they say. Never tell you which kind of pie though, do they. Alphian Toozle Witti Pie is a devil by all accounts - needs constant basting with argon. Wedgeneck Puff Suprise has to be cooked at a high temperature or the contents incubate, evolve terrible psychic powers, and force you to sell them your home. Colan Grunberry Pie has to be talked out of the oven by a team of professional hostage negotiators, otherwise it explodes and takes the main course with it. So maybe pie's not that easy after all. Now what was it you just asked me? Oh, yes.
1881 | 931 | 930 | Politicians eh. You give them your vote, you give them your heart, you give them your money and are they happy? Happy my pittocks. What they want is the larg from out of your back pocket and they're not content till they've got it. Still what's the use of complaining... Now what was it you were wanting to know? Oh yes.
1882 | 367 | 366 | Take the glass and go to the First Class Restaurant. Isn't it obvious?
1883 | 647 | 646 | So? I don't care about bombs. I just want to fix this drink.
1884 | 649 | 648 | Bombs aren't important. I'm important. I need help here.
1885 | 651 | 650 | Look at it this way. If it's going to go off it'll go off. And if it doesn't it doesn't. Either way it won't get me out of this loop.
1886 | 653 | 652 | You're looking at a bot with a major drink-fixing problem. Don't fiddle-faddle me with talk of bombs - this is important.
1887 | 625 | 624 | Nobody likes a smartass.
1888 | 627 | 626 | I do believe we've got our universes mixed up haven't we?
1889 | 629 | 628 | Very droll very droll. Let's think about the Starship Titanic instead though shall we?
1890 | 631 | 630 | Very clever, very clever. But in the end - unimpressive.
1891 | 633 | 632 | Fascinating. Astonishing. And yet meaningless.
1892 | 635 | 634 | I don't know what you're talking about. That's the official line and I'm sticking to it.
1893 | 637 | 636 | I know exactly what you mean. But let us not dwell on the past.
1894 | 639 | 638 | Interesting reference. Thought I wouldn't spot it didn't you? Well - Ha! - that's what I say to you.
1895 | 641 | 640 | Would you be trying to test me by any chance?
1896 | 645 | 644 | Good, because as I mentioned earlier, nobody likes a smartass, and I am no exception.
1897 | 643 | 642 | Well I passed. Now how about a little help with my problem?
1898 | 655 | 654 | Ah, now that would be telling.
1899 | 657 | 656 | Ah, now that would be answering.
1900 | 659 | 658 | Ah, now that would be being helpful in some way.
1901 | 661 | 660 | Ah, now there's a question.
1902 | 663 | 662 | Ah, and there's another.
1903 | 665 | 664 | Ah, it's very interesting that you should say that.
1904 | 667 | 666 | And a little bit less interesting that you should say that.
1905 | 669 | 668 | You know, I've often had the same thought meself. Well, I tell a lie, not often, in fact hardly ever at all . at all. at all...
1906 | 671 | 670 | I'll say this for the old Titanic Titillator, it gives you the attention span of a . of a . what was I going to say? . what was I going to say ...
1907 | 673 | 672 | Ah! The goldfish, a very splendid creature to be sure. He just goes round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round...
1908 | 679 | 678 | How this, how that, how's your father, how now brown cow, how should I know, how should I know.
1909 | 675 | 674 | I most certainly was not about to say any such thing! At least I think I wasn't about to say that. It's very hard to know what you're talking about when you've had a Titanic Titillator. Sometimes you just say the same thing over and over and over and over and over.
1910 | 685 | 684 | What? What's that? What's what? What are you talking about? What am I talking about? What's the point in talking to a BarBot with a fried inside? What's the point in anything... what's the point in anything... what's the point in anything...
1911 | 683 | 682 | When's this? When's that? When are you going to stop asking these senseless questions? When, oh when, oh when, oh when...
1912 | 681 | 680 | Where's this, where's that? Where's the high Panjandrum's pointy hat? Where's the pepper, where's the salt, where's the sense in anything? Where's the sense in anything?
1913 | 687 | 686 | Who do you think? Who's the cat's mother? Who's there? Who's next? Who cares? Who cares? Who cares?
1914 | 689 | 688 | Why? Why do you think? I'll tell you why. Because of the reason, that's why. Because of the reason, because of the reason...
1915 | 927 | 926 | I do like a nice shiny bar don't you? I specifically asked for glimerox in here and I'm rather pleased - I think they did a jolly fine job. How's that for a reflection eh - you have to look twice to be sure you're not standing on the ceiling. Anyway you were asking you were asking me something... Oh yes.
1916 | 839 | 838 | Alright now here we go a little bit of this and a little bit of that and more than a fairish dollop of the other and then we do a little bit of this a little bit of that and an almost embarrassing amount of the other and then voila! One Titanic Titillator for your delectation and. well we'll just be satisfied if we achieve delectation shall we? In the circumstances.
1917 | 901 | 900 | Can I interest you in a bar snack ha ha only kidding we don't have any - This is a drinks only establishment - if you want food you'll have to go to the restaurant. Not my decision oh no I'm a great food fan, I'll eat anything, any taste, anywhere, anyway up. And the spicier the better - you see I had a spell up country as a jalapo guidance system and I've never been able to look at a pepper in the same way since. Ah well, back to the grindstone. You were saying.
1918 | 915 | 914 | There's only three things you can be sure of in this life: death, taxes and spiffor. Now death and spiffor - I've got no argument with them, they're not personal. But taxes. You probably don't know this, because you're quite stupid, but each time I talk to you there's a deduction made from my credit. On days like today I'll be paying so much tax that I won't be getting paid at all. In fact I shall probably have to pay them. They charge me by the word you see. And that's 97 words. Well it's a hundred and two now. Not including that. Well a hundred and twelve just to tell you and even that's not right. A hundred and thirty two including those. Do you see? It's costing me to talk to you. A hundred and forty five. And now you've asked me a question. Well.
1919 | 951 | 950 | You know, I don't like to brag but I meet a lot of stars in this business. Oleg Wangablatter for example, the first man to extract all the juice from a lemon simply through force of personality; Calpod T-lim, renowned throughout the universe for his discovery that putting wine in bottles completely ruined it; Zalden Phta Phta, winner of the Golden Ice-Cube for his satirical ballad "Gizza Jar A Bevvy Or I'll Break Yer Hat". Bleeze Cellploy, floppunair inventor of the time-leveled reformed head-installer. Oh, yes, I've had them all in my bar at one time or another. And I've had you. Now, what was it you asked? Ah, yes.
1920 | 941 | 940 | You know when it comes to entertainment there's nothing can match the Titanic. There's bird watching up on the Promenade Deck. Music-making with the guys up in the music room. Seem to be a lot of cancellations today though: quasar-quoits with the captain has been postponed and the trim the limbs session with the millipods up on the top deck looks like it's gone down too. Things are not what they seem I can tell you... But you had a question for me and I was miles away.
1921 | 953 | 952 | Me, I'm a great fan of the work of the Irving Teitelbarg Quartet - not the most orthodox investigators but still capable of the most brilliant leaps of imagination. Did you know they once had themselves locked up for a year and a day in a sealed basement bar in an effort to discover if there was such a thing as Universal Truth? They had only cheese sandwiches and a direct link to the Shebeen distillery to sustain them. But anyway you were asking me something. Ah yes.
1922 | 955 | 954 | Anyway. Irving Teitelbarg. So, the year and a day was up and they were let out. "Is there such a thing as a Universal Truth?" they were asked. "We don't know" they said. Then someone remembered it was a leap-year and they still had a day left! So, they went back inside. Next day, the door was opened again and they filed out - "Is there such a thing as a Universal Truth?". Irving nodded. "Well, " they said, "What is it?". "Mix your drinks at a party," said Irving, "and you'll get an awful bad hangover the next day". Now that's what I call truth! But I digress. You asked me.? Oh yes.
1923 | 969 | 968 | Ballox to you. Ballox. D'ya hear me? Ballox! Swear at me will you?
1924 | 971 | 970 | Bog off you and your foul mouth you little toerag.
1925 | 973 | 972 | You swear at me you little beggar I'll bite your ears off. Well I'll have a damn good try.
1926 | 975 | 974 | Interesting observation sir - and I do believe I know the perfect place for you to keep it.
1927 | 977 | 976 | Same orifice you use for speaking you addle-pated beaver.
1928 | 979 | 978 | And the same to you with small unpleasant berry-like things on it.
1929 | 981 | 980 | Swear at me in my own bar would you? If I wasn't stuck here I'd have your guts for cables.
1930 | 983 | 982 | You low-life. Can you not string two words together without mentioning body parts?
1931 | 909 | 908 | That was some weather we had yesterday wasn't it and did we get any warning? Did me my buns. In the old days of course, a forecast was a forecast. May have been primitive but the spotter planets and electron missiles used to get it right. But anyway, you were saying - ah yes.
1932 | 911 | 910 | Oh yes, you can't beat a spotter planet when there's a solar gale bubbling up. Knocks the spots off these new retrocasts: I mean what's the point of time travelling to get the weather if you can't be sure what day it is when you get there? Too clever for their own good some of those scientist fellows, that's what I say. Still mustn't grumble. I've a bar to run. What was it you were saying. I remember.</barbot>

<bomb>What are you staring at? Do you think it's easy to keep counting backwards, while your being stared at? YOU try it! You try, having someone just staring at you while your trying to count backwards. You get all- awkward and self conscious, and... A-And I'm not meant to BE self conscious, I'm just meant to BLOW UP. So just push off, will you? Recommencing countdown; Now, One Thousand... 	

Fiddle Fiddle Fiddle! What are you doing anyway!? No, don't tell me I'm not interested. Half the night I got people trying to take that thing apart- and completely forgetting about me, then I've got somebody wandering around for hours on end trying to put it all together again and getting me all in a tiswas and making me forget what I'm doing. [Inhale] RECOMMENSING COUNTDOWN NOW; One Thousand. 	[From the first bit of this line you would think this to be another line intended for when you're fiddling with the bomb controls, but the second part implies the bomb is talking about Titania. In-game, the bomb never comments on your attempts to fix Titania.]

Nah nah ne nah nah, we're going to blow up. Just as soon as I can get a bit of peace and quiet, that is... Recommencing countdown... Now, One Thousand... 	

Look, I'm a bomb, not a bomb designer. There's no point in going on at me about aspects of my design, over which I have no control! You want a bomb designer, go and find one! You want a bomb, you've got one! You don't want a bomb... You've still got one so tough. Recommencing countdown. Now... [Inhale] One Thousand. 	[Considering that the complexity of your ability to converse with the bomb is a little more advanced then fruitlessly attempting to whack its glass panel with a hammer, this response doesn't seem to fit anywhere.]

This is very unfair of you, you know! A bomb needs to be in an appropriate frame of mind for blowing up! Calm, Focused, and Purposeful. Not all- ratty and flustered like your making me get. How am I supposed to do my best work in these conditions? Honestly!.. Recommencing countdown, now!.. One Thousand... 	

You'll notice that I'm ignoring you this time, you do whatever your doing, and I'll just do what I'm doing, which is counting down from-... Oh no- Agh- [Sounds of extreme annoyance] RECOMMENCING COUNTDOWN, NOW! ONE THOUSAND! 	

Don't talk to me, don't- don't talk to- I'm- I'm just doing A tricky bit; Eight hundred and one, Eight hundred. Six hundred and- I- I mean Sev- Seven- Seven hundred and ah [annoyed numerical stumbling]. Damn. Damn Damn Da- I wish you wouldn't even come in here you know, I mean, I'm sure your up to no good. Recommencing countdown. Now, One Thousand. 	[Another line that perhaps implies that you were able to talk to the bomb at one point... Considering every response would have to end in the bomb recommencing the count-down, it's no wonder there is no such functionality in the release game.]

Well, you said it, baby! Live with yourself if you can. 	[Most likely intended for disarming the bomb, in response to the disarm code you enter.]

Now, I've mentioned before about interrupting while I'm in the middle of a countdown: If you want a bomb you can have a good natter with, you should have got the Mega-Scuttler Pro, which has Multi-tasking, Speech recognition, and general chattering software, and therefore makes an all together more expensive Bang. As it is, you've JUST got me- uh I'm doing my best under increasingly trying conditions, if I may say so. Recommencing countdown, Now. One Thousand. 	[Another line hinting at being able to talk to the bomb at some point. A similar bomb to the "Mega-Scuttler Pro" is mentioned in the novel.]

So how many is that, that you've tried? About, Forty? Well, only another One Thousand One Hundred and Twenty Two Trillion Trillion, Two Hundred and Seventy Four Billion, One Hundred and Forty Six Million, Four Hundred and One Thousand Eight Hundred and Eighty One Trillion, Nine Hundred and Seventy Three Billion, Seven Hundred and Sixty Two Million, Thirty One Thousand Five Hundred and Seventy Six to go! So, you've set a nice pace there... and made me lose count- Ahem, [Annoyed huff] ah- Recommencing countdown, now, One Thousand. 	

Look at it this way: You can either try all the combinations, which will probably take us neatly up to the heat death of the universe, or you can solve it by being clever. Which also wont do you any good, seeing as Nobody Likes a Smart-Arse. I'd cut your losses if I were you, and run away! You've still got how many seconds is it to get out- oh damn I've lost count again. [assorted noises of aggravation] Recommencing countdown, now; One Thousand. 	[Unused line for the Bomb, in which the bomb in-directly gives you the disarm code.]

Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Three and three quarters. Three and a half. Three and three eighths. Three and a quarter. Three and three sixteenths. Three and one- look, I'm a Bomb, for heavens sake, I'm bending over backwards to be fair, and reasonable, but at the end of the day, I'm a bomb, and what bombs do, not to put too finer point on it... Is, they blow up! I don't wanna do it any more then you do but what else can I do! You want me to change into a- a Banana Meringue? I can't. I'm a bomb. I have to explode. Anything you want to say, or suggest?.. No?.. Okay, I warned you, THREETWOONE- Eh- Have you ever read Gorky Park?.. No? Well, doesn't look as if your going to either, BANG! 	[While the bomb does get annoyed at you at the end of the countdown in-game, this line is rather different to the used one, and rather than just recommencing the countdown, this one does end in a sort of a bang...]

Please do not speak to me, while I am counting. I am just a simple counting and exploding device, and am not equipped for philosophical discourse. Now you've made me lose count, you see- [sounds of increased flusteration] Recommencing countdown, now! One Thousand. 	[More unused bomb lines suggesting you're being able to talk to it.]

Look, do you think I want to blow up?
Do you think I enjoy the prospect of smearing myself all over half a parsec of space?
Well, I don't, frankly.
But we were all called upon to do things we don't like from time to time,
and you are making it very difficult for me!
Recommencing countdown. Now. One thousand.

Well, that's me done. Closing down Countdown Sequence, disarming, have a nice life!

I'd give up if I were you, you're never going to do it.
Sorry, am I making you lose your concentration?
How do you think I feel?
Recommencing countdown. One thousand.

How about Blinty Wurdle Fruitcake?
That fits, yes! Oh, except for the W.
Oh, and the F.
Well, how about Poodle Stomping Knights?
No, not enough letters.
Uh, Splattering Ghastliness?
No, that reminds me, I'm meant to be exploding, aren't I?
Damn, right.
Recommencing countdown, now.

Do you ever worry that life is passing you by?
Just a thought.
You look a little pasty and red-eyed.
Maybe you should get out a little more.
Certainly you should get out before I explode in...
How many seconds? Damn!
Recommencing countdown now.

That'll keep you busy for a while, won't it? There are 23 barrels with 15 characters on each,
which means that there are about 1,122 trillion trillion, 274,146,401,881 trillion, 973,762,031,616
combinations to try. So it's either that or get a life. What number did I get?
Bother. Recommencing countdown. Now. 1,000.

Look! No means no! Got it?
Recommencing countdown.
Now, one thousand.

Excuse me, saying "Please don't touch me" does not mean "Go on, do it again!"
It's hard to know how I can be more clear about this.
Recommence encounter. Now.

I think I said that I don't like that and I'd be grateful if you would respect my wishes.
Now I've lost count again!
Recommencing countdown now.
One thousand!
One thousand!

You are invading my personal space and I would like you to stop it!
Recommencing countdown. Now!

No, don't do that! I don't like it!
We commence encounter. Now, one thousand...

I don't like being touched, thank you.
It bothers me.
Recommencing countdown.
Now.
One thousand...

No, that's it! No more witty repartee! Just stop it! Recommencing countdown now!

There is more to life, you know, than glass.
I know it may not seem like that at the moment, but trust me, please, I may be just a simple bomb,
but I can recognize a sick mind when I encounter it.
Recommencing countdown now, one thousand.

Look, this is getting unhealthy! Why don't you go and mow the lawn or something?
Get some fresh air! Go on a quick sailing holiday or something!
This glass is unbreakable!
Just learn to accept the fact, deal with it and bugger off!
Recommencing countdown now, one thousand.

This is getting out of the realm of obsession and into the area of personality problems, isn't it?
This glass is unbreakable!
Why can't you just accept that and get on with your life?
You think I'm lying to you? I'm not!
I can see why you might think that I am, but I'm not!
Cross my heart and hope to detonate!
Recommencing countdown. Now. One thousand.

Please stop hitting the glass!
I won't tell you to read my lips because I haven't got any.
Just stop it! Go away!
I have nothing more to say on the subject.
Recommencing countdown. Now! One thousand.

Stop hitting the blasted glass, will you?
What's your problem?
Have you nothing better to do than to stand around in a deserted spaceship all day,
banging on a piece of glass you've already been told is unbreakable?
Haven't you got a relationship to go and have?
Oh, oh, sorry.
Sorry, probably a tactless remark.
Well, anyway, you made me go and lose count again.
Recommencing countdown now.
One thousand.

Still hitting the glass, I see. Absolutely futile, and also, if you don't mind my saying so, rather rude.
I'm trying to count, you've made me forget where I've got to. Recommencing countdown. Now, one thousand.

There's no point in hitting the glass, you know.
It's the single hardest thing on the ship.
I bet you that when I blow up, which I will do in however many seconds it is,
that piece of glass will be the last thing that's left.
The only thing you're breaking is my concentration.
Recommencing countdown now.

The Megascutler is now armed and preparing to explode.
This will be a fairly big explosion, so please stand back about 22 miles.
Countdown commencing...
Now, 1,000.

3...2...1...</bomb>

<titania>I'm terribly sorry about the parrot.
No, really.
I know how it must have been for you.
Leo couldn't stand parrots either.
So typical of Leo.
So clever, he could never see what was actually happening.
Everyone used to say of him, 'Nobody likes a smartass.'
He never saw how unfinished the ship was, that it was secretly being prepared for scuttling.
Even I didn't realize until it was too late.
And then they took my brain to pieces.
Thank you for restoring it to me.
My mind has been a bit of a blank, I'm afraid, and the ship has been wandering around in
a dither.
Leo has obviously been in a complete state and probably jumped off the ship when you
got onto it.
Poor old nitwit.
He's completely besotted with me.
We should find him, I suppose.
And you'll be wanting to get off home, of course.</titania>

<leovinus>Good afternoon, my name is Leovinus. You probably know that. I'm sorry about what's happened to you.
I'm even more sorry about what's happened to me. You have lost a house. I have lost a life and a dream.
You may not care about my life and my dream. Well, I don't really care about your house.
Building this ship was my dream and now that dream is over.
All I want is the love of a good woman and also
the fishing rod.
Thank you for restoring Titania. I know she isn't real. Well, she's real, but she's not really real if you see what I mean.
So to be honest, I'm more inclined to place long-term faith in the fishing rod.
By the galactic laws of salvage, this ship is now yours.
There is nothing like her in the universe. I wish you joy of her.
I hope you manage to sort out the bomb. As for me, don't try to look for me. You won't find me.
My life's work is done and I've gone fishing.
Goodbye.</leovinus></dialogue>
